# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-20)

**Core value:** The user captures WHOOP data on iPhone and it is automatically persisted on their personal server — without depending on external infrastructure. Metrics align with WHOOP from the same raw data.
**Current focus:** Phase 108 — battery-level-gen4-gen5

## Current Position

Phase: 108 (battery-level-gen4-gen5) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 1
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-06-21 — Phase 108 execution started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 17 (v13.0 complete)
- Average duration: —
- Total execution time: —

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: Phase 97 P03, Phase 97 P02, Phase 97 P01, Phase 96 P02, Phase 95 P02
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v14.0 scope: Android port (#169) is the headline feature — `android/` Kotlin/Compose + JNI bridge to existing `libgoose_core.so`; CI APK step already stubbed in `android-core.yml`
- v14.0 scope: Historical sync bugs grouped by generation — Gen5 routing (Phase 98), Gen4 reassembly (Phase 99); SEED-003/004 already completed in v12.0 (bridge/, store/, BLESessionCoordinator actor)
- v14.0 scope: BLE reliability in Phase 100 (MTU 247 + LE 2M PHY + off-wrist detection)
- v14.0 scope: P2/P3 issues (#164 Harvard sleep, #165 feature flags, #166 body composition, #167 stealth mode, #168 PIP upload) deferred to v15.0
- SEED-003/004 status: largely completed in v12.0 (phases 83-91) — bridge/ directory exists, store/ split done, BLESessionCoordinator actor live, DeviceCatalog wired; only 38 unwraps remain (ARCH-11 in Phase 110)
- MG detection: `peripheral.name?.lowercased().contains(" mg")` used in v13.0; advertisement byte layout unconfirmed (D-03); Phase 109 to harden

### Roadmap Evolution

- v14.0 Phases 98–111 defined 2026-06-20: historical sync (98-99), BLE reliability (100), telemetry+crash+protocol (101), Gen4 metrics (102), Android port (103-107), battery (108), MG (109), code health (110), comments (111)
- v13.0 Phases 92–97 shipped 2026-06-20 (all complete)

### Pending Todos

- None

### Blockers/Concerns

- HAP-04 (Phase 73, wake-window): protocol-analysis-gated — do not write implementation tasks until BLE capture of `STRAP_DRIVEN_ALARM_EXECUTED` and protocol analysis of `SetAlarmInfoCommandPacketRev4` are complete
- Phase 66 (Cap Sense): hardware-gated — requires real WHOOP 5.x device; deferred indefinitely
- Hardware gate reminder: ALG-HRV-04, ALG-SLP-04, SLP-SYNC real-device remain deferred (hardware gate)
- WHOOP MG (Phase 109): MG advertisement byte layout not yet confirmed — Phase 109 must resolve or document safe fallback
