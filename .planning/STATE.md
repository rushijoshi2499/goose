# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-03)

**Core value:** The user captures WHOOP data on iPhone and it is automatically persisted on their personal server — without depending on external infrastructure.
**Current focus:** v2.0 planning — roadmap created, ready to plan Phase 6

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (roadmap approved)
Plan: —
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-06-03 -- Phase 06 planning complete

```
Phase 6 [          ] 0%   WHOOP Gen4 iOS Support
Phase 7 [          ] 0%   Android Port Foundations + CI
Phase 8 [          ] 0%   Additional Wearables E2E
```

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0 (v2.0)
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v2.0 Phase 6 is purely iOS (Swift only) — no Rust changes needed; Rust core already supports Gen4 fully
- v2.0 Phase 7: `cargo-ndk` 4.1.2, `aarch64-linux-android` only (NOT `x86_64` or `armv7` — rusqlite bundled has open bugs on those targets); `tungstenite` must be cfg-gated on non-Android
- v2.0 Phase 7 and Phase 6 can be developed in parallel (completely different file sets)
- v2.0 Phase 8 depends on Phase 6 (needs `WearableDescriptor` abstraction introduced for Gen4)
- CI-01 (server pytest) assigned to Phase 7 (same toolchain/CI work)

### Pending Todos

- Review GEN4-01 fix location: `GooseBLEClient+Commands.swift` lines 147-165, extend `isV5CommandCharacteristic` to accept `61080002-` prefix
- WEAR-01 parser target: `Rust/core/src/heart_rate_gatt_protocol.rs` (new file)
- ADR target: `docs/ADR-android-jni.md` (new file)

### Blockers/Concerns

None active at roadmap creation.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-06-03T21:11:09.640Z
Stopped at: Phase 7 context gathered — ready for planning
Resume file: .planning/phases/07-android-port-foundations-ci/07-CONTEXT.md

## Operator Next Steps

- Run `/gsd-plan-phase 6` to plan WHOOP Gen4 iOS Support
- Run `/gsd-plan-phase 7` to plan Android Port Foundations + CI (can run in parallel with Phase 6)
