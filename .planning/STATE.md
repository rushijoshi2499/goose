# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-21)

**Core value:** The user captures WHOOP data on iPhone and it is automatically persisted on their personal server — without depending on external infrastructure. Metrics align with WHOOP from the same raw data.
**Current focus:** v15.0 — Protocol Depth, Algorithms & UX

## Current Position

Phase: 117 — Android Optical Routing
Plan: Not started
Status: Roadmap approved — ready to plan Phase 112
Last activity: 2026-06-24 — Phase 116 complete, transitioned to Phase 117

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 26 (v13.0 complete)
- Average duration: —
- Total execution time: —

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: Phase 97 P03, Phase 97 P02, Phase 97 P01, Phase 96 P02, Phase 95 P02
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v14.0 scope: Android port (#169) is the headline feature — `android/` Kotlin/Compose + JNI bridge to existing `libgoose_core.so`; CI APK step already stubbed in `android-core.yml`
- v14.0 scope: Historical sync bugs grouped by generation — Gen5 routing (Phase 98), Gen4 reassembly (Phase 99); SEED-003/004 already completed in v12.0 (bridge/, store/, BLESessionCoordinator actor)
- v14.0 scope: BLE reliability in Phase 100 (MTU 247 + LE 2M PHY + off-wrist detection)
- v14.0 scope: P2/P3 issues (#164 Harvard sleep, #165 feature flags, #166 body composition, #167 stealth mode, #168 PIP upload) deferred to v15.0
- SEED-003/004 status: largely completed in v12.0 (phases 83-91) — bridge/ directory exists, store/ split done, BLESessionCoordinator actor live, DeviceCatalog wired; only 38 unwraps remain (ARCH-11 in Phase 110)
- MG detection: `peripheral.name?.lowercased().contains(" mg")` used in v13.0; advertisement byte layout unconfirmed (D-03); Phase 109 to harden
- [Phase ?]: GET_FF_VALUE (cmd 0x80) wired into BLE handshake after sendGetBodyLocationAndStatus on every reconnect with 3s timeout fallback (FF-01, D-01, D-02)
- [Phase ?]: DeviceCapabilities uses custom Decodable init(from:) with decodeIfPresent so feature_flags absence defaults to empty dict (D-02)
- [Phase ?]: pendingFeatureFlagDeviceID captured at send time to guard disconnect race in GET_FF_VALUE response handler (T-115-03)

### Roadmap Evolution

- v14.0 Phases 98–111 defined 2026-06-20: historical sync (98-99), BLE reliability (100), telemetry+crash+protocol (101), Gen4 metrics (102), Android port (103-107), battery (108), MG (109), code health (110), comments (111)
- v15.0 Phases 112–126 defined 2026-06-22: optical protocol (112-113), Harvard sleep need (114), feature flags (115), body composition (116), Android parity (117), PIP queue (118), stealth mode (119), sleep need UI (120), body composition UI (121), stealth UI (122), real-device validation (123), PIP server (124), cap sense (125), wake-window RE-gated (126)
- v13.0 Phases 92–97 shipped 2026-06-20 (all complete)

### Pending Todos

- None

### Blockers/Concerns

- HAP-04 (Phase 73, wake-window): protocol-analysis-gated — do not write implementation tasks until BLE capture of `STRAP_DRIVEN_ALARM_EXECUTED` and protocol analysis of `SetAlarmInfoCommandPacketRev4` are complete
- Phase 66 (Cap Sense): hardware-gated — requires real WHOOP 5.x device; deferred indefinitely
- Hardware gate reminder: ALG-HRV-04, ALG-SLP-04, SLP-SYNC real-device remain deferred (hardware gate)
- WHOOP MG (Phase 109): MG advertisement byte layout not yet confirmed — Phase 109 must resolve or document safe fallback
