# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-04)

**Core value:** The user captures WHOOP data on iPhone and it is automatically persisted on their personal server — without depending on external infrastructure.
**Current focus:** Phase 09 — ble-stability-data-integrity

## Current Position

Phase: 17
Plan: 02 complete
Status: Phase 17 Plan 02 complete — HealthDataStore @Observable migration (Wave 2); 25 @Published removed; 16 consumer views rewired; AppShellView+HealthDashboardViews @State ownership; BUILD SUCCEEDED
Last activity: 2026-06-05

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 15 added: Recovery Formula V2 (SDNN Accuracy) — rename variable, remove /1.2 population approximation, track SDNN baselines natively in goose_recovery_v0 (triggered by upstream review feedback OKKHALIL3, PR #5)

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v3.0 Phase 9 first: FIX-01 (Rust-only, zero risk) unblocks HR capture testing; FIX-02+FIX-03 must be stable before HR scan UI ships
- v3.0 Phase 12 (RTC sync) and Phase 13 (Recovery V2) have no mutual dependency — parallelisable
- v3.0 Phase 14 (pt-PT) last: all v3.0 UI strings must be stable before localisation extraction
- Phase 14 Plan 01: Use String(localized:) instead of LocalizedStringKey for String-returning properties — preserves compatibility with String consumers (CoachTips, HealthScoreDateViews, HomeDashboardView)
- Phase 14 Plan 01: xcstrings keys use full English literal strings to match source code exactly
- Phase 14 Plan 03: Wave 3 added 328 entries (543 total); @Published status strings deferred to Wave 4
- Phase 17 Plan 02: @Bindable required on CalibrationHealthView when @Observable class property needs Picker binding; nonisolated(unsafe) on NSObjectProtocol observer enables deinit cleanup; lazy var incompatible with @Observable — convert to init-assigned var

### Pending Todos

- Open question: CR-02 Option A (JOIN path) vs Option B (denormalised column) — decide at Phase 9 planning
- Open question: HR scan UI placement — Health tab sheet vs. dedicated More tab entry — decide at Phase 10 planning
- Open question: Gen4 RTC command numbers (`.get = 11`, `.set = 10`) — confirm against physical device at Phase 12

### Blockers/Concerns

- RTC sync command numbers are inferred (LOW confidence) — needs device validation before Phase 12 ships
- `discoveredHRDevices` data race (BT queue vs. main thread) — RESOLVED by Phase 10.1 guards (Commands.swift + Parsing.swift)
