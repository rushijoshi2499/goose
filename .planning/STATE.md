# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-11)

**Core value:** The user captures WHOOP data on iPhone and it is automatically persisted on their personal server — without depending on external infrastructure. Metrics align with WHOOP from the same raw data.
**Current focus:** Phase 61 — BLE Bonding State Machine

## Current Position

Phase: 65 (Generic BLE State Machine) — COMPLETE
Plan: 1 of 1 (Phase 65 complete)
Status: Ready to execute Phase 66
Last activity: 2026-06-11 -- Phase 65 Plan 01 executed

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 31 (v1.0–v7.0 combined)
- Average duration: —
- Total execution time: —

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: Phase 50 P01 40min, P02 30min, P03 20min; Phase 49 P07 45min, P06 3min
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 61 Plan 02: Non-bonding error strings remain direct updateConnectionState calls; .notStarted on every disconnect; bondingState computed on GooseAppModel (no @Published)
- Phase 61 Plan 01: GooseBLEBondingManager is plain final class with callback (not @Observable); UserDefaults keys owned by manager type; .cancelled persists as notStarted (Pitfall 5)
- Phase 51 (Bug Audit): reviews phases 36–50; HIGH findings must be closed before phase closes
- Phase 52: QT-01 bt-button and QT-02 CodeQL and QT-03 HealthKit importer are all long-deferred from v2.0/v3.0
- Phase 56 (BIO-05): fabricated 55.0 bpm baseline in HealthDataStore+Recovery.swift:95 must be eliminated
- Phase 59 (BAND-01): band sleep import path is the final piece of the morning sync story started in Phase 50
- [Phase ?]: D-03 purge helper inlines Documents/GooseSwift/OvernightGuard path; try? FileManager ensures idempotency on all devices
- [Phase ?]: Band-first lifecycle: scenePhase active/foreground triggers purgeLegacyOvernightGuardDirectory then triggerForegroundBLESync; overnight guard gate eliminated
- Phase 62 Plan 01: WatermarkType enum with rawFrames/decodedStreams cases; separate UserDefaults keys per type; Foundation-only store
- Phase 62 Plan 02: effectiveSince gate inside service (not call site); watermark writes on 2xx only per type; clearAllUploadWatermarks resets both keys + lastUploadAt
- Phase 64 Plan 01: GooseHRSanitizer static value type; WHOOP parity range 25-220 BPM; onHRSpike callback (not Combine); hrSpikeCount on @MainActor via Task hop
- Phase 65 Plan 01: StateMachine<State: Hashable, Event> struct; GooseBLEBondingState promoted from Equatable to Hashable; transition(to:) total + maps to GooseBLEBondingEvent before machine.handle()
- [Phase ?]: Callback pattern (not Combine) for GooseNetworkMonitor.onReachabilityChange — consistent with GooseBLEBondingManager
- [Phase ?]: isReachable initialised to true to avoid false upload block before first async NWPath update
- [Phase ?]: apnsDeviceToken uses internal access (not private(set)) so extension setter in separate file can write it
- [Phase ?]: Upload exponential backoff capped at 60s per delay, 7 total attempts, prevents battery drain on persistent 5xx
- [Phase ?]: APNs gate is soft (warn log, not error state) - missing token before registration is expected behaviour

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 60 added: Band-First Sync — align Goose BLE sync architecture with WHOOP app (4 dimensions: historical sync on applicationWillEnterForeground, APNs push when compute_day finishes, overnight guard as supplementary, APNs wakeup trigger)

### Pending Todos

- None active for v8.0 yet

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 51 (Hardware gate) reminder: ALG-HRV-04, ALG-SLP-04, SLP-SYNC real-device remain deferred (Phase 51 in REQUIREMENTS.md Future section) — they are NOT part of v8.0
