# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-11)

**Core value:** The user captures WHOOP data on iPhone and it is automatically persisted on their personal server — without depending on external infrastructure. Metrics align with WHOOP from the same raw data.
**Current focus:** v9.0 — BLE Reliability & Protocol Parity (Phase 61 next)

## Current Position

Phase: 60 — COMPLETE
Plan: 3 of 3 (Tasks 1-3 complete; Task 4 checkpoint pending)
Status: Phase 60 complete
Last activity: 2026-06-11 -- Phase 60 marked complete

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 31 (v1.0–v7.0 combined)
- Average duration: —
- Total execution time: —

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: Phase 50 P01 40min, P02 30min, P03 20min; Phase 49 P07 45min, P06 3min
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 51 (Bug Audit): reviews phases 36–50; HIGH findings must be closed before phase closes
- Phase 52: QT-01 bt-button and QT-02 CodeQL and QT-03 HealthKit importer are all long-deferred from v2.0/v3.0
- Phase 56 (BIO-05): fabricated 55.0 bpm baseline in HealthDataStore+Recovery.swift:95 must be eliminated
- Phase 59 (BAND-01): band sleep import path is the final piece of the morning sync story started in Phase 50
- [Phase ?]: D-03 purge helper inlines Documents/GooseSwift/OvernightGuard path; try? FileManager ensures idempotency on all devices
- [Phase ?]: Band-first lifecycle: scenePhase active/foreground triggers purgeLegacyOvernightGuardDirectory then triggerForegroundBLESync; overnight guard gate eliminated

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 60 added: Band-First Sync — align Goose BLE sync architecture with WHOOP app (4 dimensions: historical sync on applicationWillEnterForeground, APNs push when compute_day finishes, overnight guard as supplementary, APNs wakeup trigger)

### Pending Todos

- None active for v8.0 yet

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 51 (Hardware gate) reminder: ALG-HRV-04, ALG-SLP-04, SLP-SYNC real-device remain deferred (Phase 51 in REQUIREMENTS.md Future section) — they are NOT part of v8.0

## Deferred Items

Items deferred from v8.0 milestone close (2026-06-11):

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| debug_session | ble-api-misuse-state-restore | awaiting_human_verify | v8.0 close |
| hardware_gate | Phase 51 — VAL-HRV-01, VAL-SLP-01, SLP-SYNC real-device | blocked | v7.0 close |
| verification_gap | Phase 22 — ALG-HRV-04 RMSSD parity (≥5 real sessions) | human_needed | v5.0 close |
| verification_gap | Phase 26 — ALG-SLP-04 4-class staging validation | human_needed | v5.0 close |

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-06-11T10:07:53.190Z
Stopped at: Completed Phase 60 Plan 03 — band-first sync integration complete, all tasks done and human-verified
Resume file: None
