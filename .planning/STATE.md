# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-04)

**Core value:** The user captures WHOOP data on iPhone and it is automatically persisted on their personal server — without depending on external infrastructure.
**Current focus:** Phase 09 — ble-stability-data-integrity

## Current Position

Phase: 10.1
Plan: Not started
Status: Executing Phase 10

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 15 added: Recovery Formula V2 (SDNN Accuracy) — rename variable, remove /1.2 population approximation, track SDNN baselines natively in goose_recovery_v0 (triggered by upstream review feedback OKKHALIL3, PR #5)

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v3.0 Phase 9 first: FIX-01 (Rust-only, zero risk) unblocks HR capture testing; FIX-02+FIX-03 must be stable before HR scan UI ships
- v3.0 Phase 12 (RTC sync) and Phase 13 (Recovery V2) have no mutual dependency — parallelisable
- v3.0 Phase 14 (pt-PT) last: all v3.0 UI strings must be stable before localisation extraction

### Pending Todos

- Open question: CR-02 Option A (JOIN path) vs Option B (denormalised column) — decide at Phase 9 planning
- Open question: HR scan UI placement — Health tab sheet vs. dedicated More tab entry — decide at Phase 10 planning
- Open question: Gen4 RTC command numbers (`.get = 11`, `.set = 10`) — confirm against physical device at Phase 12

### Blockers/Concerns

- RTC sync command numbers are inferred (LOW confidence) — needs device validation before Phase 12 ships
- `discoveredHRDevices` data race (BT queue vs. main thread) — HIGH severity pitfall to address in Phase 10
