# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-19)

**Core value:** The user captures WHOOP data on iPhone and it is automatically persisted on their personal server — without depending on external infrastructure. Metrics align with WHOOP from the same raw data.
**Current focus:** v13.0 — Phase 92 (Export & Auth Bug Fixes)

## Current Position

Phase: Milestone v13.0 initialized
Plan: —
Status: Ready to start Phase 92
Last activity: 2026-06-19 — Milestone v13.0 initialized

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 38 (v12.0 complete)
- Average duration: —
- Total execution time: —

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: Phase 91 P02, Phase 91 P01, Phase 90 P04, Phase 90 P03, Phase 90 P02
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v13.0 roadmap: Phase 92 groups export OOM (#155) + auth stuck (#154) — both are Swift-only fixes with no Rust dependency; fastest to ship together
- v13.0 roadmap: Phase 93 groups HR data investigation (#156) + protocol.rs cleanup (#157) — protocol audit may reveal root cause of #156
- v13.0 roadmap: Phase 94 groups Gen4 metric parsing (#21) + packet47 reassembly (#20) — both touch Gen4 protocol paths in the same Rust files
- v13.0 roadmap: Phase 95 is WHOOP MG DeviceKind (SEED-006, #22) — isolated new variant; no dependency on other phases
- v13.0 roadmap: Phase 96 is best practices (SEED-007) — Swift silent try? + Rust connection pool; orthogonal to protocol work
- v13.0 roadmap: Phase 97 is HealthKit Export (#109) — depends on Phase 96 (bridge reliability); new HKHealthStore writes need error handling done right
- [Phase ?]: authExhausted added to BLETransport protocol (get set) for existential binding
- [Phase ?]: Used peripheral.name?.lowercased().contains(' mg') for MG detection (candidate_MG_advertisement_byte_unverified per D-03)
- [Phase ?]: Added onCapabilitiesUpdated callback to BLETransport protocol to propagate MG generation label from transport to GooseAppModel.bleState

### Roadmap Evolution

- v13.0 Phases 92–97 defined 2026-06-19: Export+auth fixes (92), HR+protocol (93), Gen4 completeness (94), WHOOP MG (95), best practices (96), HealthKit export (97)
- v12.0 Phases 83–91 defined 2026-06-14: Protocol refactor (83), Gen4 battery (84), Rust crash safety (85), bridge.rs split + protocol comments (86), store.rs split (87), Swift ownership (88), BLE actor (89), domain ViewModels (90), threading + algorithm comments (91)

### Pending Todos

- None

### Blockers/Concerns

- HAP-04 (Phase 73, wake-window): protocol-analysis-gated — do not write implementation tasks until BLE capture of `STRAP_DRIVEN_ALARM_EXECUTED` and protocol analysis of `SetAlarmInfoCommandPacketRev4` are complete
- Phase 66 (Cap Sense): hardware-gated — requires real WHOOP 5.x device; deferred indefinitely
- Hardware gate reminder: ALG-HRV-04, ALG-SLP-04, SLP-SYNC real-device remain deferred (hardware gate)
- WHOOP MG (Phase 95): MG advertisement byte layout not yet confirmed — needs research before planning
