## v12.0 v12.0 (Shipped: 2026-06-19)

**Phases completed:** 9 phases, 38 plans, 39 tasks

**Key accomplishments:**

- SQLite migration step 22 normalises `decoded_frames.device_type` by rewriting MAVERICK/PUFFIN rows to GOOSE, and bumps CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION from 21 to 22.
- device.capabilities bridge method wired in bridge.rs and parse_device_type() rejects MAVERICK/PUFFIN, with regression tests proving DB normalization via migration step 22
- WireProtocol/HistoricalSyncKind/DeviceCapabilities types added to GooseBLETypes.swift; GooseBLEClient uses connectedCapabilities from device.capabilities bridge call instead of activeDeviceGeneration
- All 9 remaining Swift files migrated to typed connectedCapabilities/wireProtocol API; zero string-based device-type comparisons remain in GooseSwift/
- All Phase 83 structural invariants confirmed: 7 targeted test filters green, iOS BUILD SUCCEEDED, zero rustDeviceType/activeDeviceGeneration, MAVERICK/PUFFIN absent from production write paths
- protocol.rs
- Event-48 battery value wired from Rust compact summary through NotificationFrameInterpretation to applyBatteryLevel, gated on batteryViaEvent48 + wireProtocol gen4
- GooseBLEClient.swift
- `#![cfg_attr(not(test), deny(clippy::unwrap_used))]` added to lib.rs with per-module allow shields on 7 unconverted modules; bridge.rs converted from 46 test `.unwrap()` to `.expect("descriptive message")` leaving zero `.unwrap()` in the file.
- 62 test `.unwrap()` calls in store.rs converted to `.expect()` and `#![allow(clippy::unwrap_used)]` shield removed — store.rs now passes `deny(clippy::unwrap_used)` clean.
- Eliminated all 11 `.unwrap()` calls in metrics.rs (3 production + 8 test), removed the `#![allow(clippy::unwrap_used)]` shield — file now passes `deny(clippy::unwrap_used)` with zero violations.
- 8 test-code .unwrap() calls in capabilities.rs converted to .expect() with descriptive messages; #![allow(clippy::unwrap_used)] shield removed; module now passes deny(clippy::unwrap_used) cleanly
- ARCH-03 deny(clippy::unwrap_used) gate confirmed with zero lint violations; catch_unwind verified at bridge.rs FFI entry; 180 unit tests pass; 2 pre-existing export_tests failures documented as not caused by Phase 85
- 1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Fixed metric_result_to_value generic signature
- 1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Worktree was behind gsd/v12.0-milestone
- activity.rs
- Task 1: Replace placeholder test with Option A multi-file scanner
- Protocol offset and algorithm comments at all 14 non-obvious WHOOP wire-format decode sites — 11 in protocol.rs and 3 in bridge/metrics.rs.
- All integration test suites pass — bridge.rs split verified complete.
- All 49 activity-domain methods moved from store/mod.rs to store/activity.rs; store/mod.rs now contains only 7 infrastructure pub fn.
- 1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Used .environment() instead of .environmentObject() for HealthDataStore
- 1. [Rule 1 - Bug] @EnvironmentObject vs @Environment — Plan said @EnvironmentObject, actual conformance requires @Environment
- BLETransport protocol extracted from GooseBLEClient public surface; GooseBLEClient renamed to CoreBluetoothBLETransport across 13 files + xcodeproj with BUILD SUCCEEDED.
- BLESessionCoordinator actor created; GooseAppModel.ble typed as any BLETransport with 15 additional BLETransport protocol members and 12 view files updated to compile with the abstraction boundary.
- DeviceCatalog struct replaces 14 scattered `connectedCapabilities?.historicalSync/wireProtocol` guard patterns across 4 CoreBluetoothBLETransport extension files with typed computed property queries.
- All HealthState property accesses redirected through `healthState.xxx`:
- 1. [Rule 1 - Bug] CoachLocalToolContext not in plan scope

## v10.0 Protocol Parity, Haptics & Feature Completeness (Shipped: 2026-06-13)

**Phases completed:** 7 phases, 17 plans, 16 tasks

**Key accomplishments:**

- buzz(loops:) BLE command extension on GooseBLEClient — writes Data([0x13, N]) directly to commandCharacteristic with UInt8 clamping and nil-guard, no frame sequence
- BreatheView with 4s/4s/4s box-breathing loop (circle 0.6→1.0→0.6 scaleEffect), buzz(loops:1) at each phase start, Wellness section in MoreView, full navigation wiring via MoreRoute.breathe
- CoachVOWNudge priority enum (4 cases) + CoachVOWCard dismissable view inserted between CoachJournalCard and CoachRoutesSection in CoachOverviewScreen, computing urgency from existing healthStore snapshots with nil-safe Double() parse
- IntervalTimerView
- NotificationScheduler actor encapsulating all UNUserNotificationCenter calls, wired to three event sites: sleep sync completion, passive workout detection, and WHOOP battery ≤ 20%
- 1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Typo in TrendsDashboardViews.swift stroke style
- GooseAppModel.swift
- GooseWakeWindowManager.swift RE-gated stub — empty compilable class with BTSnoop/Ghidra prerequisite doc comment, registered at 4 pbxproj locations, xcodebuild succeeds

**Plans:** 9 autonomous + 3 (Phase 60) = 12 plans
**Requirements shipped:** 22/22
**Known deferred items at close:** 1 (see STATE.md Deferred Items — ble-api-misuse-state-restore debug session)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Bug audit (Phase 51): 3 HIGH + 6 MEDIUM bugs fixed in v6.0–v7.0 code; data race on GooseRustBridge NSLock eliminated; main-thread FFI safety net added
- Quick tasks & surface cleanup (Phase 52): BT Settings button wired; CodeQL CI confirmed; HealthKit importer confirmed; previewMissingData gated in #if DEBUG
- Home dashboard (Phase 53): Device Status Card (live name/state/battery/HR/sync), Tools Grid (Coach/Activity/Journal/Calibration), Evidence Footer (Rust version, store path, provenance)
- Coach content (Phases 54–55): Score summaries grid; daily journal with UserDefaults persistence; 4 route views (Sleep, Recovery, Strain, Stress) populated from bridge data
- Biometrics & activity (Phase 56): Fabricated 55.0 bpm RHR baseline eliminated; non-activity stress computation now excludes exercise session windows
- Persistence & calibration (Phase 57): Energy daily rollup persisted to SQLite; calibration pipeline uses real train/holdout splits from bridge
- More tab, previews & health algorithms (Phase 58): MorePrivacyView with export/deletion; #Preview macros for Home and More; algorithmPreferences wired to bridge catalog
- Band sleep import (Phase 59): bandSleepImportStatus replaces static "not available" UI; pipeline was already complete since Phase 50
- Band-first sync (Phase 60): Overnight poll loop removed; foreground-trigger + BGAppRefreshTask added; aligned with WHOOP's WHPBLEHistoricalDataManager pattern

- HealthDataStore async migration: 60+ bridge calls migrados de GCD para async/await; GCD queues removidos; zero sync calls na @MainActor scope (ASYNC-01, ASYNC-02)
- Morning band sleep sync: gravity K18/K24 V24History wired, syncBandSleepHistory() com SQLite-first check, "A aguardar sincronização" confirmado no simulador (SLP-SYNC-01/02/03 parcial)

## v5.0 Metrics Accuracy, IMU & Upstream Fixes (Phases 20-26) — PLANNED

**Phases:** 7 (Phases 20–26)
**Requirements:** 26 (SYNC-01–05, PERF-05, IMU-01–04, ALG-HRV-01–04, ALG-STR-01–03, ALG-CAL-01–02, ALG-SLP-01–02, ALG-REC-01–03, ALG-SLP-03–04)

**Goal:** Port validated algorithms from `my-whoop` into the Rust core — confirmed against WHOOP 5.37.0 IPA via Ghidra and peer-reviewed literature — so each metric (HRV, Recovery, Strain, Calories, Sleep) produces values aligned with WHOOP from the same raw data.
