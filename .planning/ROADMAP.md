### Phase Details

#### Phase 83: Protocol Architecture Refactor

**Goal**: Swift and Rust share a clean typed model of device identity and wire protocol — eliminating 17 string comparisons and 8 generation guards
**Depends on**: Phase 82
**Requirements**: PROTO-01, PROTO-02, PROTO-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `WireProtocol { Gen4, Gen5 }` Rust enum exists and Swift uses enum checks instead of `rustDeviceType == "GEN4"` string comparisons in frame reassembly
  2. Bridge method `device.capabilities(device_kind)` returns a `DeviceCapabilities` JSON object; GooseBLEClient caches it as `connectedCapabilities` after GATT discovery
  3. DB migration runs automatically on open and all MAVERICK/PUFFIN rows become GOOSE; `parse_device_type("MAVERICK")` returns an error after migration
  4. `cargo test --locked` passes clean and the iOS build compiles without new warnings

**Plans**: 6 plansPlans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 83-01-PLAN.md — Rust foundation: WireProtocol enum, DeviceType methods, capabilities.rs module (Wave 1)
- [x] 83-02-PLAN.md — DB migration step 22: MAVERICK/PUFFIN → GOOSE, CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION bump (Wave 1)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 83-03-PLAN.md — Bridge: device.capabilities method, BRIDGE_METHODS update, parse_device_type rejection (Wave 2)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2 completion)*

- [x] 83-04-PLAN.md — Swift types: WireProtocol enum, DeviceCapabilities, connectedCapabilities, GATT discovery call (Wave 3)
- [x] 83-05-PLAN.md — Swift guards: all 23 activeDeviceGeneration + 11 rustDeviceType sites across 9 files (Wave 3)

**Wave 4** *(blocked on Wave 3 completion)*

- [x] 83-06-PLAN.md — Phase gate: cargo test --locked full suite + iOS build verification (Wave 4)

**Cross-cutting constraints:**

- cargo test --locked passes with no regressions
- CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION is 22 in store.rs
- iOS build compiles without new warnings

**Context**: `.planning/phases/83-protocol-architecture-refactor-gen4-gen5-capability-model/83-CONTEXT.md` (design decisions finalised — read before planning)

---

#### Phase 84: Gen4 Battery

**Goal**: The app displays the real battery percentage for Gen4 WHOOP devices from the wire protocol instead of a hardcoded or unavailable value
**Depends on**: Phase 83 (DeviceCapabilities.battery_via_event48 / battery_via_cmd26 fields are required for correct dispatch)
**Requirements**: BAT-01, BAT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Event-48 payload (type 48) is parsed: offset 17 u16 LE / 10 with raw ≤ 1100 guard; result published to the battery UI for Gen4 devices
  2. Cmd 26 response is parsed: payload[2..4] u16 LE / 10 with count ≥ 4 guard; used as fallback when Event-48 has not yet been received in the session
  3. `cargo test --locked` includes at least one test for each parsing path (valid payload, boundary guard, fallback trigger)

**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:

**Wave 1**

- [x] 84-01-PLAN.md — Rust: parse_event48_battery + parse_cmd26_battery, two bridge methods, event48_battery_pct compact field, unit tests (BAT-01, BAT-02)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 84-02-PLAN.md — Swift Event-48: event48BatteryPct compact/interpretation fields + Gen4-gated dispatch via applyBatteryLevel (BAT-01)
- [x] 84-03-PLAN.md — Swift Cmd 26: BatteryCommandKind, auto-send on Gen4 connection, handleCmd26BatteryResponse via Rust bridge (BAT-02)

---

#### Phase 85: Rust Crash Safety

**Goal**: Production Rust code cannot silently panic — every error path surfaces as a typed Result and the bridge entry point is guarded by catch_unwind
**Depends on**: Phase 82 (independent of PROTO work; can run in parallel with Phase 83/84 if desired)
**Requirements**: ARCH-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `#[cfg_attr(not(test), deny(clippy::unwrap_used))]` is present in the crate and `cargo clippy` passes with zero unwrap violations in production code
  2. bridge.rs dispatcher entry point is wrapped in `catch_unwind`; panics are caught and returned as an error JSON response rather than crashing the process
  3. All 133 former `.unwrap()` sites in bridge.rs and store.rs return `Result<_, GooseError>` with a specific error variant; `cargo test --locked` passes

**Plans**: TBD

---

#### Phase 86: bridge.rs Split + Protocol Comments

**Goal**: bridge.rs is a thin router (≤ 100 lines) delegating to per-domain handler files; every WHOOP wire-format decode site carries an offset comment explaining the protocol layout
**Depends on**: Phase 85 (ARCH-03 must complete first so the split inherits Result-typed handlers; COMM-01 collocated here because offset comments belong at the handler call sites)
**Requirements**: ARCH-01, COMM-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. bridge.rs is reduced to a routing layer (≤ 100 lines); domain handlers exist as separate files (`bridge/metrics.rs`, `bridge/sleep.rs`, `bridge/capture.rs`, `bridge/activity.rs`, `bridge/debug.rs`)
  2. `BridgeRouter` trait (or equivalent dispatch mechanism) is defined and all 509 former match arms are handled via domain files
  3. Each WHOOP wire-format decode site (Event-48 battery layout, cmd 26 response, R22 battery_pct field) carries a comment with byte offsets, data type, empirical verification date, and source reference
  4. `cargo test --locked` passes with the reorganised module structure; no regressions in existing tests

**Plans**: TBD

---

#### Phase 87: store.rs Split

**Goal**: store.rs 140 public methods are reorganised into domain stores that share a connection; the schema version is validated on every SQLite open
**Depends on**: Phase 86 (bridge split must be complete before store split to avoid merge conflicts in the dispatcher)
**Requirements**: ARCH-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Domain stores exist as separate files (`store/sleep.rs`, `store/capture.rs`, `store/metrics.rs`, `store/activity.rs`) sharing `Arc<Connection>`
  2. Runtime schema version validation runs on SQLite open and returns an error if the on-disk schema version does not match the expected version
  3. All existing Rust integration tests pass (`cargo test --locked`) with the reorganised store module; no public API regressions visible to Swift

**Plans**: TBD

---

#### Phase 88: Swift Ownership — HealthDataStore

**Goal**: HealthDataStore is owned by GooseAppModel with a strong reference; AppShellView no longer creates or owns the store; circular back-references are eliminated
**Depends on**: Phase 82 (independent of Rust refactor phases; can be planned after Phase 87 ships or in parallel if no merge conflicts)
**Requirements**: ARCH-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `GooseAppModel` holds `let healthStore: HealthDataStore` as a strong reference initialised during model init
  2. `AppShellView` no longer declares `@StateObject private var healthStore`; it receives the store via `.environmentObject(model.healthStore)` injected from `GooseSwiftApp`
  3. Weak back-references from HealthDataStore to GooseAppModel and all circular closures are eliminated; the iOS build compiles without new warnings

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

---

#### Phase 89: BLE Actor Refactor

**Goal**: GooseBLEClient is replaced by a BLETransport protocol and BLESessionCoordinator actor; all Gen4/Gen5 capability branching is centralised in DeviceCatalog
**Depends on**: Phase 83 (DeviceCapabilities from Phase 83 is the source of truth for Gen4/Gen5 branching in DeviceCatalog)
**Requirements**: ARCH-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `BLETransport` protocol exists with `CoreBluetoothBLETransport` as the concrete implementation; `GooseBLEClient` is either renamed or replaced
  2. `BLESessionCoordinator` actor manages session lifecycle; BLE callbacks are dispatched through the actor isolation boundary
  3. `DeviceCatalog` struct centralises all Gen4/Gen5 branching — no `if capabilities.historicalSync == .pageSequence` guards scattered across extension files
  4. The iOS build compiles without new warnings; existing BLE session behaviour is unchanged from the user's perspective

**Plans**: TBD

---

#### Phase 90: Domain ViewModels

**Goal**: GooseAppModel is decomposed into domain-scoped Observable objects so high-frequency BLE updates do not invalidate unrelated SwiftUI views
**Depends on**: Phase 88, Phase 89 (ownership and actor refactors must be in place before splitting GooseAppModel)
**Requirements**: ARCH-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `BLEState`, `SyncState`, and `HealthState` exist as separate `@Observable` objects; SwiftUI views import only the domain object they need
  2. High-frequency BLE HR updates (1 Hz) no longer trigger redraws in views that only observe `SyncState` or `HealthState`
  3. The iOS build compiles without new warnings; all existing UI screens remain functional

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

---

#### Phase 91: Threading & Algorithm Comments

**Goal**: Threading invariants and algorithm coefficients are documented at their source in Swift and Rust so future contributors understand the synchronisation model and the empirical basis of each constant
**Depends on**: Phase 87 (COMM-02 Swift threading comments; COMM-03 algorithm comments in Rust — both are safest to land after the store split stabilises module boundaries)
**Requirements**: COMM-02, COMM-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `GooseRustBridge` usage sites and the frame reassembly buffer carry comments explaining: synchronous FFI contract, multiple-instance pattern, `@MainActor` dispatch requirement, and `NSLock` guard scope
  2. `metric_features.rs` carries comments for Banister eTRIMP (1.92/1.67 coefficients), EWMA alpha (0.0483 = 14-night half-life), and Cole-Kripke scale (0.001), each with bibliographic reference
  3. The iOS build and `cargo test --locked` pass clean; no source changes beyond comment additions

**Plans**: TBD

#### Archived phase 60 — Band-First Sync

**Goal:** Align Goose's BLE sync architecture with the WHOOP app's band-first model, eliminating the need for continuous overnight BLE capture. The band stores data onboard; the app fetches it opportunistically on foreground and via silent push, exactly as WHOOP does.

**Depends on:** Phase 59
**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete
Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 60-01-PLAN.md — Delete overnight guard subsystem core (3 files + GooseAppModel state + overnight struct types)
- [x] 60-02-PLAN.md — Add band-first sync: BandFirstSync.swift (foreground trigger + BGAppRefreshTask handler), BGTask registration, Info.plist keys

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 60-03-PLAN.md — Wire foreground trigger + clean secondary overnight references; build clean (wave 2)

#### Archived phase 61 — BLE Bonding State Machine

**Goal:** Replace the implicit OS bonding path with a formal bonding manager that tracks bond state through distinct steps, matching the `WHPBLEBondingManager` pattern from WHOOP (NotStarted → Started → Subscribed → Completed/Cancelled).

**Depends on:** Phase 60
**Requirements:** BLE-BOND-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. A `GooseBLEBondingManager` type exists with the 5 formal states; bonding progress is observable from `GooseAppModel`
2. On BT reset or iOS reboot, the app detects bond loss, re-enters the bonding flow, and reconnects without user action
3. Bonding state is persisted across app restarts so the app can resume from the last known state
4. The existing string-based `connectionState` is replaced with the formal state machine output for the bonding portion

**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

- [x] 61-01-PLAN.md — Foundation: GooseBLEBondingState enum + GooseBLEBondingManager class + localized strings
- [x] 61-02-PLAN.md — Integration: wire bonding manager into GooseBLEClient/delegate/commands + GooseAppModel observability + bond-loss detection
- [x] 61-03-PLAN.md — Human-verify checkpoint: bond-loss recovery + persistence across restart

---

#### Archived phase 62 — Upload Watermark per Sensor

**Goal:** Track the last successfully uploaded timestamp per data type (raw frames, processed metrics) so restarts and partial uploads never re-send data already in TimescaleDB.

**Depends on:** Phase 61
**Requirements:** UPLOAD-WM-01
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

- [x] 62-01-PLAN.md — Create GooseUploadWatermark store (UserDefaults, per-type Date, clearAllWatermarks)
- [x] 62-02-PLAN.md — Wire watermark into upload pipeline (gated sinceTimestamp, atomic write on 2xx, reset path)

---

#### Archived phase 63 — Network Monitor & Upload Gating

**Goal:** Gate all outbound uploads on network reachability and implement exponential-backoff retry.

**Depends on:** Phase 62
**Requirements:** NET-MON-01
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

- [x] 63-01-PLAN.md — Create GooseNetworkMonitor (NWPathMonitor wrapper) + wire isNetworkReachable into GooseAppModel
- [x] 63-02-PLAN.md — Reachability + APNs-token upload gating, connectivity-return retry, 5xx exponential backoff

---

#### Archived phase 64 — HR Data Sanitizer

**Goal:** Add a Swift-side heart rate sanitization step between raw BLE notification bytes and HeartRateSeriesStore.

**Depends on:** Phase 60
**Requirements:** HR-SAN-01
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

- [x] 64-01-PLAN.md — GooseHRSanitizer (struct + static let 25/220 thresholds), wire at recordLiveHeartRate chokepoint
- [x] 64-02-PLAN.md — Human-verify checkpoint

---

#### Archived phase 65 — Generic BLE State Machine

**Goal:** Extract a lightweight reusable StateMachine<State, Event> type and migrate BLE connection/bonding state.

**Depends on:** Phase 61
**Requirements:** SM-01
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete

- [x] 65-01-PLAN.md — Add generic StateMachine<State, Event> struct + migrate GooseBLEBondingManager onto it

---

#### Archived phase 66 — Cap Sense / On-Wrist Detection

**Goal:** Identify the GATT characteristic for WHOOP's capacitive skin-contact sensor via Ghidra and implement on-wrist detection.

**Depends on:** Phase 60
**Requirements:** CAPSENSE-01
**Note:** GATT characteristic UUID for cap sense is not yet identified. Phase deferred — hardware gate.
**Plans:** 0 plans
