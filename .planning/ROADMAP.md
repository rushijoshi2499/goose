### Phase Details

#### Phase 83: Protocol Architecture Refactor

**Goal**: Swift and Rust share a clean typed model of device identity and wire protocol — eliminating 17 string comparisons and 8 generation guards
**Depends on**: Phase 82
**Requirements**: PROTO-01, PROTO-02, PROTO-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `WireProtocol { Gen4, Gen5 }` Rust enum exists and Swift uses enum checks instead of `rustDeviceType == "GEN4"` string comparisons in frame reassembly
  2. Bridge method `device.capabilities(device_kind)` returns a `DeviceCapabilities` JSON object; GooseBLEClient caches it as `connectedCapabilities` after GATT discovery
  3. DB migration runs automatically on open and all MAVERICK/PUFFIN rows become GOOSE; `parse_device_type("MAVERICK")` returns an error after migration
  4. `cargo test --locked` passes clean and the iOS build compiles without new warnings

**Plans**: 6 plansPlans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 83-01-PLAN.md — Rust foundation: WireProtocol enum, DeviceType methods, capabilities.rs module (Wave 1)
- [x] 83-02-PLAN.md — DB migration step 22: MAVERICK/PUFFIN → GOOSE, CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION bump (Wave 1)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 83-03-PLAN.md — Bridge: device.capabilities method, BRIDGE_METHODS update, parse_device_type rejection (Wave 2)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2 completion)*

- [x] 83-04-PLAN.md — Swift types: WireProtocol enum, DeviceCapabilities, connectedCapabilities, GATT discovery call (Wave 3)
- [x] 83-05-PLAN.md — Swift guards: all 23 activeDeviceGeneration + 11 rustDeviceType sites across 9 files (Wave 3)

**Wave 4** *(blocked on Wave 3 completion)*

- [x] 83-06-PLAN.md — Phase gate: cargo test --locked full suite + iOS build verification (Wave 4)

**Cross-cutting constraints:**

- cargo test --locked passes with no regressions
- CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION is 22 in store.rs
- iOS build compiles without new warnings

**Context**: `.planning/phases/83-protocol-architecture-refactor-gen4-gen5-capability-model/83-CONTEXT.md` (design decisions finalised — read before planning)

---

#### Phase 84: Gen4 Battery

**Goal**: The app displays the real battery percentage for Gen4 WHOOP devices from the wire protocol instead of a hardcoded or unavailable value
**Depends on**: Phase 83 (DeviceCapabilities.battery_via_event48 / battery_via_cmd26 fields are required for correct dispatch)
**Requirements**: BAT-01, BAT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Event-48 payload (type 48) is parsed: offset 17 u16 LE / 10 with raw ≤ 1100 guard; result published to the battery UI for Gen4 devices
  2. Cmd 26 response is parsed: payload[2..4] u16 LE / 10 with count ≥ 4 guard; used as fallback when Event-48 has not yet been received in the session
  3. `cargo test --locked` includes at least one test for each parsing path (valid payload, boundary guard, fallback trigger)

**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:

**Wave 1**

- [x] 84-01-PLAN.md — Rust: parse_event48_battery + parse_cmd26_battery, two bridge methods, event48_battery_pct compact field, unit tests (BAT-01, BAT-02)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 84-02-PLAN.md — Swift Event-48: event48BatteryPct compact/interpretation fields + Gen4-gated dispatch via applyBatteryLevel (BAT-01)
- [x] 84-03-PLAN.md — Swift Cmd 26: BatteryCommandKind, auto-send on Gen4 connection, handleCmd26BatteryResponse via Rust bridge (BAT-02)

---

#### Phase 85: Rust Crash Safety

**Goal**: Production Rust code cannot silently panic — every error path surfaces as a typed Result and the bridge entry point is guarded by catch_unwind
**Depends on**: Phase 82 (independent of PROTO work; can run in parallel with Phase 83/84 if desired)
**Requirements**: ARCH-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `#[cfg_attr(not(test), deny(clippy::unwrap_used))]` is present in the crate and `cargo clippy` passes with zero unwrap violations in production code
  2. bridge.rs dispatcher entry point is wrapped in `catch_unwind`; panics are caught and returned as an error JSON response rather than crashing the process
  3. All 133 former `.unwrap()` sites in bridge.rs and store.rs return `Result<_, GooseError>` with a specific error variant; `cargo test --locked` passes

**Plans**: 6 plans

**Wave 1**

- [x] 87-01-PLAN.md — Create store/ skeleton: store/mod.rs (Arc<Mutex<Connection>>, immediate_transaction fix), git rm store.rs, update capture_import.rs + bridge call sites, 4 empty domain stubs (Wave 1)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 87-02-PLAN.md — Move 13 sleep methods to store/sleep.rs (Wave 2, parallel)
- [x] 87-03-PLAN.md — Move 25 capture methods to store/capture.rs (Wave 2, parallel)
- [x] 87-04-PLAN.md — Move ~49 metrics methods to store/metrics.rs (Wave 2, parallel)
- [x] 87-05-PLAN.md — Move 49 activity methods to store/activity.rs (Wave 2, parallel)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2 completion)*

- [ ] 87-06-PLAN.md — Gate: cargo test --locked + cargo clippy --lib + human checkpoint (Wave 3)

---

#### Phase 86: bridge.rs Split + Protocol Comments

**Goal**: bridge.rs is a thin router (≤ 100 lines) delegating to per-domain handler files; every WHOOP wire-format decode site carries an offset comment explaining the protocol layout
**Depends on**: Phase 85 (ARCH-03 must complete first so the split inherits Result-typed handlers; COMM-01 collocated here because offset comments belong at the handler call sites)
**Requirements**: ARCH-01, COMM-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. bridge.rs is reduced to a routing layer (≤ 100 lines); domain handlers exist as separate files (`bridge/metrics.rs`, `bridge/sleep.rs`, `bridge/capture.rs`, `bridge/activity.rs`, `bridge/debug.rs`)
  2. `BridgeRouter` trait (or equivalent dispatch mechanism) is defined and all 509 former match arms are handled via domain files
  3. Each WHOOP wire-format decode site (Event-48 battery layout, cmd 26 response, R22 battery_pct field) carries a comment with byte offsets, data type, empirical verification date, and source reference
  4. `cargo test --locked` passes with the reorganised module structure; no regressions in existing tests

**Plans**: 6 plans

**Wave 1**

- [x] 86-01-PLAN.md — Create bridge/ skeleton: mod.rs router shell + 5 domain stubs, delete bridge.rs (Wave 1)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 86-02-PLAN.md — Fill bridge/metrics.rs, bridge/sleep.rs, bridge/capture.rs with domain arms (Wave 2, parallel)
- [x] 86-03-PLAN.md — Fill bridge/activity.rs, bridge/debug.rs with domain arms + validation.* aliases (Wave 2, parallel)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2 completion)*

- [x] 86-04-PLAN.md — Update include_str! scanner to scan all 5 domain files (Option A multi-file) (Wave 3)

**Wave 4** *(blocked on Wave 3 completion)*

- [x] 86-05-PLAN.md — Add COMM-01 offset comments: 11 sites in protocol.rs + 3 in bridge/metrics.rs (Wave 4)

**Wave 5** *(blocked on Wave 4 completion)*

- [ ] 86-06-PLAN.md — Phase gate: cargo test --locked + clippy + human checkpoint (Wave 5)

---

#### Phase 87: store.rs Split

**Goal**: store.rs 140 public methods are reorganised into domain stores that share a connection; the schema version is validated on every SQLite open
**Depends on**: Phase 86 (bridge split must be complete before store split to avoid merge conflicts in the dispatcher)
**Requirements**: ARCH-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Domain stores exist as separate files (`store/sleep.rs`, `store/capture.rs`, `store/metrics.rs`, `store/activity.rs`) sharing `Arc<Connection>`
  2. Runtime schema version validation runs on SQLite open and returns an error if the on-disk schema version does not match the expected version
  3. All existing Rust integration tests pass (`cargo test --locked`) with the reorganised store module; no public API regressions visible to Swift

**Plans**: TBD

---

#### Phase 88: Swift Ownership — HealthDataStore

**Goal**: HealthDataStore is owned by GooseAppModel with a strong reference; AppShellView no longer creates or owns the store; circular back-references are eliminated
**Depends on**: Phase 82 (independent of Rust refactor phases; can be planned after Phase 87 ships or in parallel if no merge conflicts)
**Requirements**: ARCH-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `GooseAppModel` holds `let healthStore: HealthDataStore` as a strong reference initialised during model init
  2. `AppShellView` no longer declares `@StateObject private var healthStore`; it receives the store via `.environmentObject(model.healthStore)` injected from `GooseSwiftApp`
  3. Weak back-references from HealthDataStore to GooseAppModel and all circular closures are eliminated; the iOS build compiles without new warnings

**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:

- [ ] 88-01-PLAN.md — Transfer HealthDataStore ownership into GooseAppModel; wire environmentObject
- [ ] 88-02-PLAN.md — Convert all child views from parameter to @EnvironmentObject

**UI hint**: yes

---

#### Phase 89: BLE Actor Refactor

**Goal**: GooseBLEClient is replaced by a BLETransport protocol and BLESessionCoordinator actor; all Gen4/Gen5 capability branching is centralised in DeviceCatalog
**Depends on**: Phase 83 (DeviceCapabilities from Phase 83 is the source of truth for Gen4/Gen5 branching in DeviceCatalog)
**Requirements**: ARCH-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `BLETransport` protocol exists with `CoreBluetoothBLETransport` as the concrete implementation; `GooseBLEClient` is either renamed or replaced
  2. `BLESessionCoordinator` actor manages session lifecycle; BLE callbacks are dispatched through the actor isolation boundary
  3. `DeviceCatalog` struct centralises all Gen4/Gen5 branching — no `if capabilities.historicalSync == .pageSequence` guards scattered across extension files
  4. The iOS build compiles without new warnings; existing BLE session behaviour is unchanged from the user's perspective

**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:

- [ ] 89-01-PLAN.md — BLETransport protocol + rename GooseBLEClient → CoreBluetoothBLETransport (13 files)
- [ ] 89-02-PLAN.md — BLESessionCoordinator actor + GooseAppModel.ble → any BLETransport
- [ ] 89-03-PLAN.md — DeviceCatalog struct + replace Gen4/Gen5 capability guards

---

#### Phase 90: Domain ViewModels

**Goal**: GooseAppModel is decomposed into domain-scoped Observable objects so high-frequency BLE updates do not invalidate unrelated SwiftUI views
**Depends on**: Phase 88, Phase 89 (ownership and actor refactors must be in place before splitting GooseAppModel)
**Requirements**: ARCH-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `BLEState`, `SyncState`, and `HealthState` exist as separate `@Observable` objects; SwiftUI views import only the domain object they need
  2. High-frequency BLE HR updates (1 Hz) no longer trigger redraws in views that only observe `SyncState` or `HealthState`
  3. The iOS build compiles without new warnings; all existing UI screens remain functional

**Plans**: 4 plans
Plans:

- [ ] 90-01-PLAN.md — Create BLEState.swift, SyncState.swift, HealthState.swift + register in Xcode project
- [ ] 90-02-PLAN.md — Migrate GooseAppModel.swift: remove 36 var properties, add 3 domain object lets
- [ ] 90-03-PLAN.md — Update GooseAppModel extension files to write through domain objects
- [ ] 90-04-PLAN.md — Inject domain objects in GooseSwiftApp, update view files, build gate

**UI hint**: yes

---

#### Phase 91: Threading & Algorithm Comments

**Goal**: Threading invariants and algorithm coefficients are documented at their source in Swift and Rust so future contributors understand the synchronisation model and the empirical basis of each constant
**Depends on**: Phase 87 (COMM-02 Swift threading comments; COMM-03 algorithm comments in Rust — both are safest to land after the store split stabilises module boundaries)
**Requirements**: COMM-02, COMM-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `GooseRustBridge` usage sites and the frame reassembly buffer carry comments explaining: synchronous FFI contract, multiple-instance pattern, `@MainActor` dispatch requirement, and `NSLock` guard scope
  2. `metric_features.rs` carries comments for Banister eTRIMP (1.92/1.67 coefficients), EWMA alpha (0.0483 = 14-night half-life), and Cole-Kripke scale (0.001), each with bibliographic reference
  3. The iOS build and `cargo test --locked` pass clean; no source changes beyond comment additions

**Plans**: TBD

**Depends on**: Phase 83
**Requirements**: BAT-01, BAT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

**Depends on**: Phase 82
**Requirements**: ARCH-03

**Goal**: bridge.rs is a thin router (≤ 100 lines) delegating to per-domain handler files; every WHOOP wire-format decode site carries an offset comment explaining the protocol layout
**Depends on**: Phase 85
**Requirements**: ARCH-01, COMM-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. bridge.rs is reduced to a routing layer (≤ 100 lines); domain handlers exist as separate files (`bridge/metrics.rs`, `bridge/sleep.rs`, `bridge/capture.rs`, `bridge/activity.rs`, `bridge/debug.rs`)
  2. `BridgeRouter` trait (or equivalent dispatch mechanism) is defined and all 509 former match arms are handled via domain files
  3. Each WHOOP wire-format decode site (Event-48 battery layout, cmd 26 response, R22 battery_pct field) carries a comment with byte offsets, data type, empirical verification date, and source reference
  4. `cargo test --locked` passes with the reorganised module structure; no regressions in existing tests

**Plans**: 6 plans

**Wave 1**

- [x] 86-01-PLAN.md — Create bridge/ skeleton: bridge/mod.rs router + 5 empty domain stubs, delete bridge.rs (Wave 1)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1)*

- [x] 86-02-PLAN.md — Fill metrics.rs, sleep.rs, capture.rs domain handlers (Wave 2)
- [x] 86-03-PLAN.md — Fill activity.rs, debug.rs + validation.* alias arms (Wave 2)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2)*

- [x] 86-04-PLAN.md — Update include_str! self-scanner test to multi-file concatenation (Wave 3)

**Wave 4** *(blocked on Wave 3)*

- [x] 86-05-PLAN.md — COMM-01 protocol offset comments: 11 sites in protocol.rs + 3 in bridge/metrics.rs (Wave 4)

**Wave 5** *(blocked on Wave 4)*

- [x] 86-06-PLAN.md — Gate: cargo test --locked + cargo clippy --lib + human checkpoint (Wave 5)

### Phase 87: store.rs Split

**Goal**: store.rs 140 public methods are reorganised into domain stores that share a connection; the schema version is validated on every SQLite open
**Depends on**: Phase 86
**Requirements**: ARCH-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Domain stores exist as separate files (`store/sleep.rs`, `store/capture.rs`, `store/metrics.rs`, `store/activity.rs`) sharing `Arc<Connection>`
  2. Runtime schema version validation runs on SQLite open and returns an error if the on-disk schema version does not match the expected version
  3. All existing Rust integration tests pass (`cargo test --locked`) with the reorganised store module; no public API regressions visible to Swift

**Plans**: 6 plans

**Wave 1**

- [ ] 87-01-PLAN.md — Create store/ skeleton: store/mod.rs (Arc<Mutex<Connection>>, immediate_transaction fix), git rm store.rs, update capture_import.rs + bridge call sites, 4 empty domain stubs (Wave 1)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [ ] 87-02-PLAN.md — Move 13 sleep methods to store/sleep.rs (Wave 2, parallel)
- [ ] 87-03-PLAN.md — Move 25 capture methods to store/capture.rs (Wave 2, parallel)
- [ ] 87-04-PLAN.md — Move ~49 metrics methods to store/metrics.rs (Wave 2, parallel)
- [ ] 87-05-PLAN.md — Move 49 activity methods to store/activity.rs (Wave 2, parallel)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2 completion)*

- [ ] 87-06-PLAN.md — Gate: cargo test --locked + cargo clippy --lib + human checkpoint (Wave 3)

### Phase 88: Swift Ownership — HealthDataStore

**Goal**: HealthDataStore is owned by GooseAppModel with a strong reference; AppShellView no longer creates or owns the store; circular back-references are eliminated
**Depends on**: Phase 82
**Requirements**: ARCH-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `GooseAppModel` holds `let healthStore: HealthDataStore` as a strong reference initialised during model init
  2. `AppShellView` no longer declares `@StateObject private var healthStore`; it receives the store via `.environmentObject(model.healthStore)` injected from `GooseSwiftApp`
  3. Weak back-references from HealthDataStore to GooseAppModel and all circular closures are eliminated; the iOS build compiles without new warnings

**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:

- [ ] 88-01-PLAN.md — Transfer HealthDataStore ownership into GooseAppModel; wire environmentObject
- [ ] 88-02-PLAN.md — Convert all child views from parameter to @EnvironmentObject

**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 89: BLE Actor Refactor

**Goal**: GooseBLEClient is replaced by a BLETransport protocol and BLESessionCoordinator actor; all Gen4/Gen5 capability branching is centralised in DeviceCatalog
**Depends on**: Phase 83, Phase 88
**Requirements**: ARCH-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `BLETransport` protocol exists with `CoreBluetoothBLETransport` as the concrete implementation; `GooseBLEClient` is either renamed or replaced
  2. `BLESessionCoordinator` actor manages session lifecycle; BLE callbacks are dispatched through the actor isolation boundary
  3. `DeviceCatalog` struct centralises all Gen4/Gen5 branching — no `if capabilities.historicalSync == .pageSequence` guards scattered across extension files
  4. The iOS build compiles without new warnings; existing BLE session behaviour is unchanged from the user's perspective

**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:

- [ ] 89-01-PLAN.md — BLETransport protocol + rename GooseBLEClient → CoreBluetoothBLETransport (13 files)
- [ ] 89-02-PLAN.md — BLESessionCoordinator actor + GooseAppModel.ble → any BLETransport
- [ ] 89-03-PLAN.md — DeviceCatalog struct + replace Gen4/Gen5 capability guards

### Phase 90: Domain ViewModels

**Goal**: GooseAppModel is decomposed into domain-scoped Observable objects so high-frequency BLE updates do not invalidate unrelated SwiftUI views
**Depends on**: Phase 88, Phase 89
**Requirements**: ARCH-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `BLEState`, `SyncState`, and `HealthState` exist as separate `@Observable` objects; SwiftUI views import only the domain object they need
  2. High-frequency BLE HR updates (1 Hz) no longer trigger redraws in views that only observe `SyncState` or `HealthState`
  3. The iOS build compiles without new warnings; all existing UI screens remain functional

**Plans**: 4 plans
Plans:

- [ ] 90-01-PLAN.md — Create BLEState.swift, SyncState.swift, HealthState.swift + register in Xcode project
- [ ] 90-02-PLAN.md — Migrate GooseAppModel.swift: remove 36 var properties, add 3 domain object lets
- [ ] 90-03-PLAN.md — Update GooseAppModel extension files to write through domain objects
- [ ] 90-04-PLAN.md — Inject domain objects in GooseSwiftApp, update view files, build gate

**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 91: Threading & Algorithm Comments

**Goal**: Threading invariants and algorithm coefficients are documented at their source in Swift and Rust so future contributors understand the synchronisation model and the empirical basis of each constant
**Depends on**: Phase 87
**Requirements**: COMM-02, COMM-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `GooseRustBridge` usage sites and the frame reassembly buffer carry comments explaining: synchronous FFI contract, multiple-instance pattern, `@MainActor` dispatch requirement, and `NSLock` guard scope
  2. `metric_features.rs` carries comments for Banister eTRIMP (1.92/1.67 coefficients), EWMA alpha (0.0483 = 14-night half-life), and Cole-Kripke scale (0.001), each with bibliographic reference
  3. The iOS build and `cargo test --locked` pass clean; no source changes beyond comment additions

**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [ ] 91-01-PLAN.md — Swift threading invariant comments (COMM-02): GooseRustBridge, CaptureFrameWriteQueue, OvernightSQLiteMirrorQueue, GooseAppModel
- [ ] 91-02-PLAN.md — Rust algorithm coefficient comments (COMM-03): Banister eTRIMP, EWMA alpha, Cole-Kripke scale

## v13.0 Bug Fixes, Protocol Reliability, Device Coverage & HealthKit Export (Phases 92–97)

### Phase Details

#### Phase 92: Export & Auth Bug Fixes

**Goal**: Export pipeline no longer OOMs on large databases; WHOOP 5.0 auth stuck state surfaces a clear recovery path
**Depends on**: Phase 91
**Requirements**: BUG-AUTH-01, BUG-EXP-01, BUG-EXP-02, BUG-EXP-03, BUG-EXP-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Export on a > 100 MB database completes without crash — validation pipeline passes manifest by reference, not serialised object
  2. `runFullRawExport()` does not override `includeRawBytes = false`
  3. `validate()` is called once inside `createBundle()` — redundant call removed
  4. "Include Database" button is disabled when SQLite file exceeds 20 MB
  5. WHOOP 5.0 that exhausts 12 auth retries surfaces a "Reconnect WHOOP" prompt and stops retrying
  6. iOS build compiles without new warnings

**Plans**:
1/3 plans executed

- [x] 92-02-PLAN.md — Fix export defaults + disable OOM-risk button (BUG-EXP-02, BUG-EXP-04)
- [x] 92-03-PLAN.md — Fix WHOOP 5.0 auth stuck state recovery (BUG-AUTH-01)

---

#### Phase 93: HR Data Investigation & Protocol Cleanup

**Goal**: Root cause of no HR data on WHOOP 5.0 fw 50.38.1.0 identified and fixed; protocol.rs PACKET_TYPE constants replaced with enum; silent parse drops eliminated
**Depends on**: Phase 91
**Requirements**: BUG-HR-01, PROTO-08, PROTO-09, PROTO-10, PROTO-11
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. WHOOP 5.0 firmware 50.38.1.0 successfully streams HR data in the app
  2. `PACKET_TYPE_*` u16 constants replaced with a Rust enum; all match sites are exhaustive
  3. `parse_data_packet_body_summary` has no silent wildcard arm — unhandled packet_k values produce a warning string
  4. Every packet type in `data_packet_domain()` has a corresponding parse arm in `parse_data_packet_body_summary()`
  5. Bridge routing uses a central dispatch registry; `CommandDefinition` array is in sync
  6. `cargo test --locked` passes clean

**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 93-01-PLAN.md — Fix BUG-HR-01: add R22Whoop5Hr arm to heart_rate_plan_from_row + r22_whoop5_hr to trusted_frames (Wave 1)
- [x] 93-02-PLAN.md — Introduce PacketType enum, delete 17 PACKET_TYPE_* constants, migrate 5 match sites (Wave 1)
- [x] 93-03-PLAN.md — Unknown variant in DataPacketBodySummary, replace wildcard, COMMAND_DEFINITIONS registry test (Wave 2)

---

#### Phase 94: Gen4 Protocol Completeness

**Goal**: WHOOP 4.0 users see respiratory rate and skin temperature in Recovery; Gen4 historical sync completes without dropping packet47 bodies
**Depends on**: Phase 93
**Requirements**: GEN4-06, SYNC-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `MetricFeatures.respiratory_rate_rpm` and `skin_temp_delta_c` are populated from Gen4 packet bytes — not `None`
  2. Gen4 historical sync on service UUID `61080005` produces packet47 body rows in SQLite — no bodies dropped
  3. `cargo test --locked` passes clean; Rust test fixtures updated for new parse paths

**Plans**:

- [x] 94-01-PLAN.md — Gen4 recovery metric parsing: respiratory_rate + skin_temp byte offsets in Rust (GEN4-06)
- [x] 94-02-PLAN.md — Gen4 packet47 page_sequence reassembly fix (SYNC-07)

---

#### Phase 95: WHOOP MG DeviceKind

**Goal**: WHOOP MG devices are identified as a separate DeviceKind; sync no longer fails with generic Whoop5 capabilities
**Depends on**: Phase 83 (DeviceKind infrastructure)
**Requirements**: MG-01, MG-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `DeviceKind::WhoopMg` exists in Rust capabilities.rs with `DeviceCapabilities` reflecting MG-specific flags
  2. `DeviceType::MG` (or equivalent) maps to `DeviceKind::WhoopMg` in `protocol.rs`
  3. iOS app parses WHOOP MG BLE advertisement and sets `connectedCapabilities` to WhoopMg
  4. Device view shows "WHOOP MG" label for MG devices; no regression on Whoop4/Whoop5 identification
  5. `cargo test --locked` passes clean

**Plans**: 2/2 plans complete

Plans:

- [x] 95-01-PLAN.md — Add DeviceKind::WhoopMg to Rust capabilities.rs + remap Maverick in protocol.rs (MG-01)
- [x] 95-02-PLAN.md — Swift: 3-way MG BLE detection + deviceKind bridge field + connectedDeviceGeneration label (MG-02)

---

#### Phase 96: Best Practices Gaps

**Goal**: Critical data paths no longer silently swallow bridge errors; Rust core uses a connection pool
**Depends on**: Phase 91
**Requirements**: BP-01, BP-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. All 9 silent `try?` bridge calls in Swift replaced with `do/catch` + `ble.record(level: .error, ...)` — failures are logged
  2. Rust core opens SQLite via a connection pool — per-request `Connection::open()` calls eliminated in bridge handlers
  3. iOS build compiles without new warnings; `cargo test --locked` passes clean

**Plans**:

1/2 plans executed

- [x] 96-02-PLAN.md — Rust SQLite connection pool (BP-02)

---

#### Phase 97: HealthKit Export — Bevel Integration

**Goal**: WHOOP metrics written to HealthKit automatically; Bevel and other apps can read WHOOP data via HealthKit
**Depends on**: Phase 96 (bridge error handling in place before new HK write paths)
**Requirements**: HK-01, HK-02, HK-03, HK-04, HK-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. HR samples captured from WHOOP appear in Health app under Heart Rate source "Goose"
  2. HRV (RMSSD or SDNN), SpO2, and sleep session data appear in Health app under respective categories
  3. HealthKit write is controlled by a toggle in More settings (default off); no data written without user opt-in
  4. Write errors are logged — HK permission denied is handled gracefully without crash
  5. iOS build compiles without new warnings; existing HealthKit read functionality unaffected

**Plans**: 4/4 plans complete

**Wave 1** (parallel)

- [x] 97-01-PLAN.md — Rust bridge methods: store.hr_samples_between, store.spo2_samples_between (inline SpO2), store.external_sleep_sessions_between (HK-01, HK-03, HK-04)
- [x] 97-04-PLAN.md — More settings toggle: @AppStorage goose.healthkit.export.enabled + UI in Section("Apple Health") + write gating (HK-05)

**Wave 2** (blocked on Wave 1)

- [x] 97-02-PLAN.md — GooseHealthKitExporter.swift: HKHealthStore setup, requestAuthorization, write helpers for HR/HRV/SpO2/sleep, project.pbxproj registration (HK-01..HK-05)

**Wave 3** (blocked on Wave 2)

- [x] 97-03-PLAN.md — Trigger integration: exportAfterSleepSync() call at end of syncBandSleepHistory() + enableHealthKitExport() full impl + permission-denied recovery (HK-01..HK-05)

### Phase Details

#### Phase 112: Optical Protocol Decode (v20/v21/v26)

**Goal**: WHOOP 5.0 type-47 v20/v21 multi-channel and v26 PPG waveform packets are parsed in protocol.rs instead of silently falling to Unknown
**Depends on**: Phase 111
**Requirements**: OPT-01, OPT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `DataPacketBodySummary::V20V21OpticalMultiChannel` variant exists; packet_k 20 and 21 decode presence-byte logic (0x19=active, 0x00=empty) and 3×100-sample i16 arrays without panicking on a valid synthetic payload
  2. `DataPacketBodySummary::V26PpgWaveform` variant exists; packet_k 26 decodes 24×LE-i16 at offsets [27:74] with ppg_channel gated 1–26; integration test with synthetic 88 B payload passes
  3. WHY comments at all new byte offsets; `cargo test --locked` passes clean with no regression in existing protocol tests
  4. No silent wildcard fallthrough for packet_k 20, 21, or 26 — all three route to named variants in `parse_data_packet_body_summary`

**Plans**: 2/2 plans complete
Plans:

- [x] 112-01-PLAN.md — V26PpgWaveform variant + parse_v26_ppg_body + synthetic 88B fixture tests (OPT-02)
- [x] 112-02-PLAN.md — V20V21OpticalMultiChannel variant + OpticalChannel struct + parse_v20v21_optical_body + synthetic v20/v21 fixture tests (OPT-01)

**Dependencies**: Pure Rust — no Swift or Android changes in this phase

---

#### Phase 113: Schema v24 + Optical Bridge Methods

**Goal**: A single schema v24 migration creates all four new tables (optical_channel_samples, device_feature_flags, body_composition_history, realtime_frames), bridge insert/query methods are registered, and `cargo test --locked` passes as the gate for all subsequent Swift consumer phases
**Depends on**: Phase 112
**Requirements**: OPT-03, FF-03, BODY-01 (schema only), PIP-02 (schema only)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 24` in store.rs; migration block creates all four tables in a single transaction; the schema version guard on open returns an error for any on-disk version below 24
  2. `biometrics.insert_v20v21_batch` and `biometrics.insert_v26_batch` bridge methods insert rows into `optical_channel_samples`; range query methods return rows by (device_uuid, ts range)
  3. `BRIDGE_METHODS` constant is updated; `bridge_methods_constant_matches_dispatcher` test passes
  4. `cargo test --locked` passes clean — this is the green gate before any Swift consumer work begins

**Plans**: 0/1 plans executed
Plans:

- [ ] 113-01-PLAN.md — Schema v24 migration (4 tables) + optical bridge methods + capabilities bridge + integration tests

---

#### Phase 114: Harvard Sleep Need Model

**Goal**: The Harvard sleep need model (age-bracket baseline + EWMA debt + strain adjustment) replaces the hardcoded 480-minute constant throughout the Rust codebase
**Depends on**: Phase 113
**Requirements**: SLP-NEED-01, SLP-NEED-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `sleep_need.rs` exists with `compute_sleep_need(age_years, 5-night history, prior_strain) -> SleepNeedResult`; age-bracket baselines (18–25: 8h, 26–64: 7.5h, 65+: 7h) are correct; Rust unit tests cover cold-start, each age bracket, and strain adjustment thresholds
  2. The hardcoded `480.0` constant in `SleepFeatureScoreOptions` and `RecoveryFeatureScoreOptions` is replaced with a bridge call to `sleep.compute_need`; `age_years: Option<u8>` is accepted in the options struct
  3. `bridge_methods_constant_matches_dispatcher` test passes; `cargo test --locked` passes clean

**Plans**: 2/2 plans complete

- [x] 114-01-PLAN.md — sleep_need.rs algorithm module: compute_sleep_need + compute_sleep_need_with_store + SleepNeedResult (SLP-NEED-01, Wave 1)
- [x] 114-02-PLAN.md — sleep.compute_need bridge method + replace hardcoded 480.0 at 4 call sites (SLP-NEED-02, Wave 2)

---

#### Phase 115: Feature Flag Discovery (GET_FF_VALUE)

**Goal**: The app discovers WHOOP device feature flags by sending GET_FF_VALUE (cmd 0x80) after handshake and storing results in SQLite and DeviceCapabilities
**Depends on**: Phase 113
**Requirements**: FF-01, FF-02, FF-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `GET_FF_VALUE` (cmd 0x80) is sent from Swift after `GET_HELLO` handshake completes; a 3-second timeout triggers fallback to `DeviceKind`-derived `DeviceCapabilities` if no response arrives
  2. The response is parsed into `DeviceCapabilities.feature_flags: [UInt8: UInt8]`; raw index→value is stored without semantic name claims; the flag map is visible in the Debug tab
  3. `device_feature_flags` table exists (schema v24 already landed in Phase 113); `capabilities.get_feature_flags` bridge method inserts and retrieves rows; `BRIDGE_METHODS` updated

**Plans**: 1/2 plans executed

- [x] 115-01-PLAN.md — Swift: add DeviceCapabilities.featureFlags + send GET_FF_VALUE in handshake with 3s timeout + parse response + bridge upsert (FF-01, FF-02)
- [ ] 115-02-PLAN.md — Swift: display feature flags in Debug tab Runtime section as hex pairs / "None discovered" (FF-02, FF-03)

**UI hint**: yes

---

#### Phase 116: Body Composition Rust Layer

**Goal**: The Rust bridge can upsert and query body composition records; the schema v24 table is the single source of truth for weight, BMI, body fat, and muscle mass history
**Depends on**: Phase 113
**Requirements**: BODY-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `body_composition_history` table exists (schema v24 already landed in Phase 113); UNIQUE(source, date) constraint is enforced; INSERT OR REPLACE semantics work for healthkit-sourced rows
  2. `body_composition.upsert` and `body_composition.history_between` bridge methods are registered in `BRIDGE_METHODS` and the dispatcher; `cargo test --locked` passes with at least one test per method
  3. `source` column accepts only 'manual', 'healthkit', or 'scale' (CHECK constraint); inserting an invalid source returns an error, not a panic

**Plans**: TBD

---

#### Phase 117: Android Optical Routing

**Goal**: Android WhoopBleClient forwards packet_k 20, 21, and 26 frames to GooseBridge.safeHandle() achieving parity with the iOS v15.0 optical decode path
**Depends on**: Phase 112
**Requirements**: OPT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `WhoopBleClient.kt` routing table handles packet_k 20, 21, and 26 — frames are forwarded to `GooseBridge.safeHandle()` rather than discarded or logged as unknown
  2. The existing Android CI APK build (`android-core.yml`) compiles without new warnings or errors after the routing change
  3. Unit test or log assertion confirms that a synthetic v20/v21/v26 frame received by `FrameReassembler` reaches the bridge call

**Plans**: TBD

---

#### Phase 118: PIP Realtime Queue

**Goal**: A dedicated Swift queue tags BLE frames as FRAME_SOURCE_REALTIME and inserts them into the realtime_frames SQLite table via bridge, keeping realtime capture isolated from historical capture
**Depends on**: Phase 113
**Requirements**: PIP-01, PIP-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `RealtimePIPQueue` Swift class exists as a parallel to `CaptureFrameWriteQueue` with its own `NSLock` and `writeQueue`; frames are tagged `FRAME_SOURCE_REALTIME` before insertion
  2. Realtime frames land in `realtime_frames` (schema v24, already present from Phase 113); `synced = 0` on insert; a covering index on (device_uuid, captured_at) exists
  3. `CaptureFrameWriteQueue` and `RealtimePIPQueue` are distinct — no shared queue or table; backpressure accounting is independent

**Plans**: TBD

---

#### Phase 119: Stealth Mode (Rust + Swift core)

**Goal**: Per-metric UserDefaults toggles suppress individual metric values from dashboard views and replace them with a sentinel in Coach context so the LLM cannot read hidden values
**Depends on**: Phase 111
**Requirements**: STEALTH-01, STEALTH-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `GooseStealthMode.isHidden(metric:)` exists with `StealthStorage` enum holding `static let` UserDefaults keys for all 6 metrics (recovery_score, strain_score, hrv_rmssd, resting_hr, sleep_performance, stress_score)
  2. `StealthMask` value type is passed into `CoachLocalToolContext.build()`; hidden metric values are replaced with `"hidden_by_user"` sentinel string (key preserved); Coach still receives full unmasked data for recommendations
  3. Neither class reads UserDefaults with ad-hoc string literals — all key references go through `StealthStorage` constants

**Plans**: TBD

---

#### Phase 120: Sleep Need UI

**Goal**: The Sleep dashboard displays a dynamic nightly sleep need derived from the Harvard model instead of the static "8h recommended" label
**Depends on**: Phase 114
**Requirements**: SLP-NEED-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Sleep dashboard shows `SleepNeedResult.total_need_minutes` expressed as hours and minutes (e.g. "7h 45m recommended tonight")
  2. An optional breakdown row shows base / debt / strain components when available; the label is absent when the bridge call returns an error or no history exists
  3. The iOS build compiles without new warnings; SwiftUI `#Preview` macro compiles in DEBUG

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

---

#### Phase 121: Body Composition UI + HealthKit Import

**Goal**: Users can manually log body composition entries and import HealthKit weight history; both appear on a trend chart in the Health tab
**Depends on**: Phase 116
**Requirements**: BODY-02, BODY-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `BodyCompositionEntrySheet` appears in the Health tab; user can enter weight, body fat %, and muscle mass; tapping Confirm calls `body_composition.upsert` via bridge with source='manual'
  2. HealthKit import reads `HKQuantityTypeIdentifierBodyMass` and `HKQuantityTypeIdentifierBodyFatPercentage`; rows are written with source='healthkit' using INSERT OR REPLACE
  3. A weight sparkline or trend chart in the Health tab renders at least 7 days of history when data is present; the chart is absent (not crashed) when no data exists

**Plans**: TBD

#### Phase 122: Stealth UI

**Goal**: A Settings → Metrics toggle list lets users hide individual metrics; dashboard views render "—" for hidden metrics at the view layer
**Depends on**: Phase 119
**Requirements**: STEALTH-03, STEALTH-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Settings → Metrics section lists all 6 stealth-eligible metrics with Toggle controls backed by `StealthStorage` UserDefaults keys (no ad-hoc string literals)
  2. All dashboard views that render stealth-eligible metric values call `GooseStealthMode.isHidden(metric:)` at the render site and display "—" when the metric is hidden
  3. `#if DEBUG` previews use `StealthMask` environment value rather than direct UserDefaults reads; SwiftUI preview compiles clean

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

---

#### Phase 123: Real-Device Algorithm Validation (VAL-HRV-04, VAL-SLP-04)

**Goal**: RMSSD and 4-class sleep staging are cross-validated on ≥7 real WHOOP 5 overnight sessions, closing the hardware-gated validation items open since v5.0
**Depends on**: Phase 111
**Requirements**: VAL-HRV-04, VAL-SLP-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. RMSSD delta vs the Python reference pipeline is ≤1 ms on all ≥7 real overnight sessions; validation fixtures (synthetic equivalents) are committed to `Rust/core/tests/`
  2. 4-class sleep staging concordance is ≥70% on all ≥7 real overnight sessions; results are documented as a validation artifact in `.planning/phases/123-*/`
  3. `cargo test --locked` passes with the new Rust fixture tests; no algorithm coefficients or constants were changed to force concordance

**Plans**: TBD

---

#### Phase 124: PIP Server Endpoint

**Goal**: The server accepts realtime BLE frames via POST /v1/ingest-realtime and stores them in a TimescaleDB hypertable
**Depends on**: Phase 118
**Requirements**: PIP-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `POST /v1/ingest-realtime` endpoint exists in the FastAPI server with Bearer token auth matching the pattern of `/v1/ingest-frames`; the endpoint returns 200 on valid payloads and 401 on missing/invalid auth
  2. `realtime_frames` TimescaleDB hypertable is created on first deploy; time-partitioned on `captured_at`; existing server tests pass
  3. The endpoint rejects payloads missing `device_uuid` or `frame_hex` with a 422 response; pytest test suite confirms all three cases

**Plans**: TBD

---

#### Phase 125: Cap Sense UUID Discovery

**Goal**: With a real WHOOP 5 device available, the capacitive sense GATT characteristic UUID is identified and on-wrist detection is subscribed separately from the cmd 0x54 optical fallback
**Depends on**: Phase 111
**Requirements**: CAPSENSE-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. The GATT characteristic UUID for the WHOOP 5 capacitive sense sensor is identified (via BLE scan log or Ghidra) and documented in `.planning/research/whoop-re/CAPSENSE-UUID.md`
  2. Swift subscribes to the characteristic; `isOnWrist` is updated from the cap sense notification stream — distinct from the cmd 0x54 BLE-02 path already in production
  3. The Debug tab shows the cap sense UUID and its current value; no regression in the existing cmd 0x54 off-wrist detection

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

---

#### Phase 126: Wake-Window Engine (HAP-04)

**Goal**: GooseWakeWindowManager stub is filled with the wake-window algorithm using the confirmed SetAlarmInfoCommandPacketRev4 wire format
**Depends on**: Phase 111, `.planning/research/whoop-re/SetAlarmInfoCommandPacketRev4.md` existing
**Requirements**: HAP-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `SetAlarmInfoCommandPacketRev4.md` exists in `.planning/research/whoop-re/` with confirmed byte layout before any implementation begins
  2. `GooseWakeWindowManager` sends the correct alarm command payload using the confirmed wire format; BTSnoop capture of `STRAP_DRIVEN_ALARM_EXECUTED` confirms the device fires at the target window
  3. HAP-03 smart alarm UI (Phase 73) continues to function — no regression; the wake-window engine is activated only when the RE prerequisite file is present

**Note**: **DEFERRED TO v16.0** if `.planning/research/whoop-re/SetAlarmInfoCommandPacketRev4.md` does not exist at execution time. Do not begin implementation tasks for this phase until that file is confirmed present.

**Plans**: TBD

#### Archived phase 60 — Band-First Sync

**Goal:** Align Goose's BLE sync architecture with the WHOOP app's band-first model, eliminating the need for continuous overnight BLE capture. The band stores data onboard; the app fetches it opportunistically on foreground and via silent push, exactly as WHOOP does.

**Depends on:** Phase 59
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

#### Archived phase 61 — BLE Bonding State Machine

**Goal:** Replace the implicit OS bonding path with a formal bonding manager that tracks bond state through distinct steps, matching the `WHPBLEBondingManager` pattern from WHOOP (NotStarted → Started → Subscribed → Completed/Cancelled).

**Depends on:** Phase 60
**Requirements:** BLE-BOND-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. A `GooseBLEBondingManager` type exists with the 5 formal states; bonding progress is observable from `GooseAppModel`
2. On BT reset or iOS reboot, the app detects bond loss, re-enters the bonding flow, and reconnects without user action
3. Bonding state is persisted across app restarts so the app can resume from the last known state
4. The existing string-based `connectionState` is replaced with the formal state machine output for the bonding portion

**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

- [x] 61-01-PLAN.md — Foundation: GooseBLEBondingState enum + GooseBLEBondingManager class + localized strings
- [x] 61-02-PLAN.md — Integration: wire bonding manager into GooseBLEClient/delegate/commands + GooseAppModel observability + bond-loss detection
- [x] 61-03-PLAN.md — Human-verify checkpoint: bond-loss recovery + persistence across restart

---

#### Archived phase 62 — Upload Watermark per Sensor

**Goal:** Track the last successfully uploaded timestamp per data type (raw frames, processed metrics) so restarts and partial uploads never re-send data already in TimescaleDB.

**Depends on:** Phase 61
**Requirements:** UPLOAD-WM-01
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

- [x] 62-01-PLAN.md — Create GooseUploadWatermark store (UserDefaults, per-type Date, clearAllWatermarks)
- [x] 62-02-PLAN.md — Wire watermark into upload pipeline (gated sinceTimestamp, atomic write on 2xx, reset path)

---

#### Archived phase 63 — Network Monitor & Upload Gating

**Goal:** Gate all outbound uploads on network reachability and implement exponential-backoff retry.

**Depends on:** Phase 62
**Requirements:** NET-MON-01
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

- [x] 63-01-PLAN.md — Create GooseNetworkMonitor (NWPathMonitor wrapper) + wire isNetworkReachable into GooseAppModel
- [x] 63-02-PLAN.md — Reachability + APNs-token upload gating, connectivity-return retry, 5xx exponential backoff

---

#### Archived phase 64 — HR Data Sanitizer

**Goal:** Add a Swift-side heart rate sanitization step between raw BLE notification bytes and HeartRateSeriesStore.

**Depends on:** Phase 60
**Requirements:** HR-SAN-01
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

- [x] 64-01-PLAN.md — GooseHRSanitizer (struct + static let 25/220 thresholds), wire at recordLiveHeartRate chokepoint
- [x] 64-02-PLAN.md — Human-verify checkpoint

---

#### Archived phase 65 — Generic BLE State Machine

**Goal:** Extract a lightweight reusable StateMachine<State, Event> type and migrate BLE connection/bonding state.

**Depends on:** Phase 61
**Requirements:** SM-01
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete

- [x] 65-01-PLAN.md — Add generic StateMachine<State, Event> struct + migrate GooseBLEBondingManager onto it

---

#### Archived phase 66 — Cap Sense / On-Wrist Detection

**Goal:** Identify the GATT characteristic for WHOOP's capacitive skin-contact sensor via Ghidra and implement on-wrist detection.

**Depends on:** Phase 60
**Requirements:** CAPSENSE-01
**Note:** GATT characteristic UUID for cap sense is not yet identified. Phase deferred — hardware gate.
**Plans:** 0 plans
