# Goose — Multi-Device Biometric Platform

## What This Is

Fork of `b-nnett/goose`: an iOS app (SwiftUI + Rust core) that reads biometric data from WHOOP devices via BLE and persists it on a self-hosted server.
v1.0 delivered: FastAPI+TimescaleDB server, automatic iOS→server upload, integration of 9 upstream PRs.
v2.0 expanded: full WHOOP 4.0 (Gen4) support, Android JNI foundations, standard HR GATT pipeline.
v3.0 completed: HR monitor scan UI + independent capture, BLE stability, Recovery V2 dashboard, pt-PT localisation, WHOOP 4.0 RTC sync, SDNN accuracy fix.
v4.0 delivered: URL scheme security (deep link guard), full `@Observable` migration, four-provider Coach (ChatGPT/Claude/Custom/Gemini), complete pt-PT localisation for v4.0 strings.
v5.0 shipped (2026-06-08): Validated algorithm pipeline — HRV (BLE-gap-aware RMSSD + Lipponen-Tarvainen filter), Sleep staging (Cole-Kripke scale=0.001 + 4-class), Strain/Calories (Ghidra-confirmed Keytel/H-B coefficients), V24 biometric decode (SpO2/skin_temp/resp/gravity2), Exercise detection (retroactive, Karvonen zones), Upload sync (synced flag + cursors), Readiness Engine (ACWR + Foster monotony). Schema v19. 128 Rust tests. 9 audit HIGH findings fixed.
v6.0 shipped (2026-06-09): All v5.0 Rust algorithms wired to SwiftUI dashboards — Readiness Engine, Sleep Staging (4-class hypnogram + AASM), V24 Biometrics, Exercise Sessions, Upload Sync UI, IMU Step Detection. Algorithm alignment: recovery Z-score weights, EWMA 14-night alpha, Cole-Kripke 30s epochs. Raw BLE frame upload/import (trust-chain). Test Connection + Import do servidor UI. 0 untranslated pt-PT strings.
v7.0 shipped (2026-06-10): Sync correctness + async migration — upload route pair complete (POST /v1/ingest-frames + GET export), device_uuid end-to-end (CoreBluetooth → SQLite → server), upload sync race fix (pre-capture rowIDs), HealthDataStore full async/await migration (60+ calls, GCD removed), morning band sleep sync (gravity K18/K24 extraction → Cole-Kripke → external_sleep_sessions). Algorithm defaults promoted to v1. Phase 51 (real-device validation) deferred — hardware gate.

## Core Value

The user must be able to capture WHOOP data on iPhone and have it persisted automatically on their personal server — without depending on external infrastructure. Metrics (HRV, Recovery, Strain, Calorias, Sleep) must align with what WHOOP itself produces from the same raw data.

### Out of Scope

- Upload queue persisted in SQLite to survive app restarts
- Background URLSession for upload when the app is suspended
- PRs back to upstream b-nnett/goose with fork fixes
- Server-side data analysis (dashboard, alerts) — out of scope
- Advanced authentication (OAuth, 2FA) — simple Bearer token is sufficient
- Full Android app — architecture foundations only in v2.0
- Offline mode — real-time is core value

## Context

- **Fork**: `tigercraft4/goose` is a fork of `https://github.com/b-nnett/goose`
- **Upstream open PRs**: #19 (rmssd_segment_aware, body_hex), #26 (Gen4 historical sync review)
- **my-whoop server**: `~/Documents/my-whoop/server/` — FastAPI, TimescaleDB; algorithm validation source at `~/Documents/my-whoop/server/ingest/app/analysis/`
- **Ghidra analysis**: WHOOP 5.37.0 IPA binary reverse-engineered (2026-06-01) — calorie coefficients confirmed (FINDINGS_5.md §GHIDRA-HB-01 + §GHIDRA-02)

## Constraints

- **iOS tech stack**: Swift / SwiftUI / URLSession — do not introduce external dependencies
- **Server tech stack**: FastAPI + TimescaleDB (maintain compatibility with existing my-whoop)
- **Git**: planning docs in git (commit_docs: true)
- **Server**: must run in Docker on the user's personal server

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Copy full server to server/ in Goose | Keep everything in one repo; simplify deployment with a single git pull | ✓ Good — v1.0 |
| Upload via native URLSession | No external iOS dependencies; URLSession is sufficient for POST JSON | ✓ Good — v1.0 |
| Simple Bearer token for server auth | Personal/private server; OAuth overhead unnecessary | ✓ Good — v1.0 |
| GOOSE_ prefix for env vars and containers | Aligned with fork repo; avoids confusion with my-whoop | ✓ Good — v1.0 |
| Docker named volumes (no DATA_ROOT) | Zero config for `docker compose up` | ✓ Good — v1.0 |
| mDNS .local for server hostname | Automatic LAN discovery; zero DNS config | ✓ Good — v1.0 |
| Phase ordering: Phase 17 @Observable before Phase 18 Coach | CoachView must consume @Observable pattern | ✓ Good — v4.0 |
| Four Coach providers in wave approach | Each provider independent; no merge conflicts on CoachProviderRegistry | ✓ Good — v4.0 |
| Google OAuth via WKWebView (no SDK) | Zero external dependency; user-supplied client_id; PKCE mandatory | ✓ Good — v4.0 |
| Inline L10N gap closure (9 strings, no new phase) | Faster than planning a new phase for 9-string fix | ✓ Good — v4.0 |

## Current Milestone: v9.0 BLE Reliability & Protocol Parity

**Goal:** Close the critical architectural gaps identified by Ghidra RE of WHOOP v5.37.0. Formal bonding state machine, per-sensor upload watermarks, network monitor gating, HR sanitizer, generic state machine, and cap sense on-wrist detection.

**Target features:**
- Phase 61: Formal BLE bonding state machine (WHPBLEBondingManager parity)
- Phase 62: Per-sensor upload watermark (WHPStrapLatestUploadedMetricDateKey parity)
- Phase 63: NWPathMonitor-based upload gating + exponential backoff
- Phase 64: HR spike sanitizer before HeartRateSeriesStore
- Phase 65: Generic StateMachine<State, Event> type; BLE states migrated
- Phase 66: Cap sense GATT UUID identification + on-wrist detection (blocked until UUID found)

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone checkpoints.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to record? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if it has drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Out of Scope audit — are the reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
