# Goose — Multi-Device Biometric Platform

## What This Is

Fork of `b-nnett/goose`: an iOS app (SwiftUI + Rust core) that reads biometric data from WHOOP devices via BLE and persists it on a self-hosted server.
v1.0 delivered: FastAPI+TimescaleDB server, automatic iOS→server upload, integration of 9 upstream PRs.
v2.0 expanded: full WHOOP 4.0 (Gen4) support, Android JNI foundations, standard HR GATT pipeline.
v3.0 completed: HR monitor scan UI + independent capture, BLE stability, Recovery V2 dashboard, pt-PT localisation, WHOOP 4.0 RTC sync, SDNN accuracy fix.
v4.0 delivered: URL scheme security (deep link guard), full `@Observable` migration, four-provider Coach (ChatGPT/Claude/Custom/Gemini), complete pt-PT localisation for v4.0 strings.
v5.0 shipped (2026-06-08): Validated algorithm pipeline — HRV (BLE-gap-aware RMSSD + Lipponen-Tarvainen filter), Sleep staging (Cole-Kripke scale=0.001 + 4-class), Strain/Calories (Ghidra-confirmed Keytel/H-B coefficients), V24 biometric decode (SpO2/skin_temp/resp/gravity2), Exercise detection (retroactive, Karvonen zones), Upload sync (synced flag + cursors), Readiness Engine (ACWR + Foster monotony). Schema v19. 128 Rust tests. 9 audit HIGH findings fixed.
v6.0 shipped (2026-06-09): All v5.0 Rust algorithms wired to SwiftUI dashboards — Readiness Engine, Sleep Staging (4-class hypnogram + AASM), V24 Biometrics, Exercise Sessions, Upload Sync UI, IMU Step Detection. Algorithm alignment: recovery Z-score weights, EWMA 14-night alpha, Cole-Kripke 30s epochs. Raw BLE frame upload/import (trust-chain). Test Connection + Import do servidor UI. 0 untranslated pt-PT strings.

## Core Value

The user must be able to capture WHOOP data on iPhone and have it persisted automatically on their personal server — without depending on external infrastructure. Metrics (HRV, Recovery, Strain, Calorias, Sleep) must align with what WHOOP itself produces from the same raw data.

- [ ] ALG-SLP-04 human gate: 4-class staging concordância ≥70% em ≥5 sessões overnight reais
- [ ] BT button → abre definições iOS de Bluetooth (backlog, low priority)

### Out of Scope

- Upload queue persisted in SQLite to survive app restarts
- Background URLSession for upload when the app is suspended
- PRs back to upstream b-nnett/goose with fork fixes
- Server-side data analysis (dashboard, alerts) — out of scope
- Advanced authentication (OAuth, 2FA) — simple Bearer token is sufficient
- Full Android app — architecture foundations only in v2.0
- Offline mode — real-time is core value

## Context

- **Fork**: `tigercraft4/goose` is a fork of `https://github.com/b-nnett/goose`
- **Upstream open PRs**: #19 (rmssd_segment_aware, body_hex), #26 (Gen4 historical sync review)
- **my-whoop server**: `~/Documents/my-whoop/server/` — FastAPI, TimescaleDB; algorithm validation source at `~/Documents/my-whoop/server/ingest/app/analysis/`
- **Ghidra analysis**: WHOOP 5.37.0 IPA binary reverse-engineered (2026-06-01) — calorie coefficients confirmed (FINDINGS_5.md §GHIDRA-HB-01 + §GHIDRA-02)

## Constraints

- **iOS tech stack**: Swift / SwiftUI / URLSession — do not introduce external dependencies
- **Server tech stack**: FastAPI + TimescaleDB (maintain compatibility with existing my-whoop)
- **Git**: planning docs in git (commit_docs: true)
- **Server**: must run in Docker on the user's personal server

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Copy full server to server/ in Goose | Keep everything in one repo; simplify deployment with a single git pull | ✓ Good — v1.0 |
| Upload via native URLSession | No external iOS dependencies; URLSession is sufficient for POST JSON | ✓ Good — v1.0 |
| Simple Bearer token for server auth | Personal/private server; OAuth overhead unnecessary | ✓ Good — v1.0 |
| GOOSE_ prefix for env vars and containers | Aligned with fork repo; avoids confusion with my-whoop | ✓ Good — v1.0 |
| Docker named volumes (no DATA_ROOT) | Zero config for `docker compose up` | ✓ Good — v1.0 |
| mDNS .local for server hostname | Automatic LAN discovery; zero DNS config | ✓ Good — v1.0 |
| Phase ordering: Phase 17 @Observable before Phase 18 Coach | CoachView must consume @Observable pattern | ✓ Good — v4.0 |
| Four Coach providers in wave approach | Each provider independent; no merge conflicts on CoachProviderRegistry | ✓ Good — v4.0 |
| Google OAuth via WKWebView (no SDK) | Zero external dependency; user-supplied client_id; PKCE mandatory | ✓ Good — v4.0 |
| Inline L10N gap closure (9 strings, no new phase) | Faster than planning a new phase for 9-string fix | ✓ Good — v4.0 |

## Current State: v6.0 SHIPPED 2026-06-09

All v5.0 Rust algorithms are now wired to SwiftUI. The app shows Recovery readiness level, Sleep hypnogram, V24 biometrics, Exercise sessions, Step counter, and Upload sync status. Algorithm alignment corrected. Raw BLE frame upload/import with trust-chain reconstruction. Full pt-PT localisation.

**Next milestone (v7.0):** Close the real overnight parity gates (ALG-HRV-04, ALG-SLP-04) once enough device data is collected. Define scope with `/gsd-new-milestone`.

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone checkpoints.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to record? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if it has drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Out of Scope audit — are the reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
