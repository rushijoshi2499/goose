# Requirements: Goose v13.0

# Bug Fixes, Protocol Reliability, Device Coverage & HealthKit Export

*Milestone goal: Fechar os bugs reportados no fork (export OOM, auth stuck, HR data), limpar a protocol layer (enum, silent drops), adicionar WHOOP MG como DeviceKind, corrigir métricas Gen4 em falta, e exportar dados WHOOP para HealthKit (Bevel integration).*

---

## Bug Fixes

- [x] **BUG-AUTH-01**: User can recover from WHOOP 5.0 auth stuck state — app detects retry exhaustion, surfaces clear "Reconnect WHOOP" prompt, halts retry loop (closes #154)
- [ ] **BUG-EXP-01**: User can export on databases > 100 MB without OOM crash — validation pipeline passes manifest by reference/ID, not serialised object (closes #155 primary)
- [ ] **BUG-EXP-02**: User running full raw export does not silently bypass safe defaults — `runFullRawExport()` respects `includeRawBytes = false` (closes #155 Bug 1)
- [ ] **BUG-EXP-03**: User's export bundle creation calls `validate()` once — redundant bridge call in `createBundle()` removed (closes #155 Bug 2)
- [ ] **BUG-EXP-04**: User cannot trigger OOM-risk database export by accident — "Include Database" button disabled when SQLite > 20 MB (closes #155 Bug 3)
- [ ] **BUG-HR-01**: User with WHOOP 5.0 firmware 50.38.1.0 receives HR data and metrics — root cause identified and fixed (closes #156)

## Protocol Layer

- [ ] **PROTO-08**: Rust `PACKET_TYPE_*` u16 constants replaced with enum — compiler enforces exhaustion at match sites (closes #157 finding 1/2)
- [ ] **PROTO-09**: `parse_data_packet_body_summary` has no silent wildcard — unhandled packet_k values push an explicit warning string (closes #157 finding 3)
- [ ] **PROTO-10**: `data_packet_domain()` and `parse_data_packet_body_summary()` are in sync — every domain-annotated packet type has a parse arm (closes #157 finding 5)
- [ ] **PROTO-11**: Bridge routing uses central dispatch registry — `CommandDefinition` array kept in sync with bridge handlers (closes #157 finding 6/7)

## Gen4 Protocol Completeness

- [ ] **GEN4-06**: User with WHOOP 4.0 sees respiratory rate and skin temperature in Recovery dashboard — Gen4 byte offsets parsed into `MetricFeatures.respiratory_rate_rpm` and `skin_temp_delta_c` (closes #21)
- [ ] **SYNC-07**: WHOOP 4.0 historical sync completes without dropping packet47 bodies — page_sequence reassembly fixed for service UUID `61080005` (closes #20)

## WHOOP MG Support

- [ ] **MG-01**: `DeviceKind::WhoopMg` variant added to Rust core with `DeviceCapabilities` reflecting MG-specific protocol flags — MG devices no longer misidentified as Whoop5 (closes #22, SEED-006)
- [x] **MG-02**: iOS app identifies WHOOP MG from BLE advertisement and sets `connectedCapabilities` to `WhoopMg` — device view shows correct generation label

## Best Practices

- [ ] **BP-01**: 9 silent `try?` bridge calls in Swift replaced with `do/catch` + `ble.record(level: .error, ...)` — critical data paths (capture.import_frame_batch, sync.backfill_streams) log failures instead of discarding them silently (SEED-007 Gap 1)
- [ ] **BP-02**: Rust core uses a SQLite connection pool — per-request connection open overhead eliminated; pool size tuned to bridge concurrency model (SEED-007 Gap 2)

## HealthKit Export — Bevel Integration

- [ ] **HK-01**: User can have WHOOP HR samples written to HealthKit (`HKQuantityTypeIdentifierHeartRate`) automatically (closes #109)
- [ ] **HK-02**: User can have WHOOP HRV written to HealthKit (`HKQuantityTypeIdentifierHeartRateVariabilitySDNN`)
- [ ] **HK-03**: User can have WHOOP SpO2 written to HealthKit (`HKQuantityTypeIdentifierOxygenSaturation`)
- [ ] **HK-04**: User can have WHOOP sleep sessions written to HealthKit (`HKCategoryTypeIdentifierSleepAnalysis`)
- [ ] **HK-05**: User controls HealthKit export via toggle in More settings (opt-in, default off) — no data written without explicit opt-in

## Future Requirements

- BUG-WAL-01: Export "Include Database" exports a WAL-checkpointed snapshot — WAL/SHM trio excluded or checkpointed before bundle (#155 Bug 4) — deferred; lower priority than OOM fix
- PROTO-12: `strap_event_name()` 23 hardcoded arms → reference table (#157 finding 4) — deferred; cosmetic, no correctness impact
- BP-03: `nonisolated(unsafe)` without explicit locks in Swift — SEED-007 Gap 3; deferred; secondary priority

## Out of Scope

- TestFlight distribution (#153) — requires Apple developer program setup; out of scope for this milestone
- iCloud sync / NOOP interoperability (#57) — significant scope; deferred
- Additional wearables (Amazfit, Fitbit Air, etc.) (#14) — out of scope; focus on WHOOP family
- Android port (#9) — architecture foundations already in place; full Android app out of scope
- Bevel direct API integration — HealthKit write is sufficient; no direct Bevel API dependency needed
