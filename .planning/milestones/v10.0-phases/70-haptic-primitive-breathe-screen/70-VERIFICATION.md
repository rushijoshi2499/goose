# Phase 70: Haptic Primitive + Breathe Screen Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** The app can command the WHOOP 5.0 strap to vibrate via BLE cmd 0x13, and the Breathe screen delivers a paced haptic session using that primitive
**Verified:** 2026-06-12T14:30:00Z
**Status:** human_needed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | `buzz(loops:)` method exists on `GooseBLEClient` via `GooseBLEClient+Haptics.swift` and issues cmd 0x13 over command characteristic | ✓ VERIFIED | File exists at `GooseSwift/GooseBLEClient+Haptics.swift`; `func buzz(loops: Int)` confirmed; payload is `Data([0x13, clamped])` written via `activePeripheral.writeValue(_:for:type:)`; OSLog line `buzz.sent` with loops count and writeType present |
| 2 | Breathe screen is accessible from app, completes full breath cycle (inhale/hold/exhale), calls `buzz(loops:)` at each phase transition | ✓ VERIFIED | `BreatheView.swift` exists; `model.ble.buzz(loops: 1)` called 3 times (inhale line 107, hold line 117, exhale line 122); 4s duration per phase via `BreathePhase.duration = 4.0`; `MoreRoute.breathe` wired in `MoreView.swift` `Section("Wellness")` — runtime confirmation is human-only |
| 3 | Breathe session can be started and stopped; stopping mid-session does not leave BLE in undefined state | ✓ VERIFIED | `stopSession()` calls `phaseTask?.cancel(); phaseTask = nil; isRunning = false`; `.onDisappear { stopSession() }` present at line 99; `buzz` is fire-and-forget with no pending state — BLE characteristic left in clean state by design |
| 4 | No buzz attempted when no WHOOP connected — UI shows appropriate disabled state | ✓ VERIFIED | Disconnected banner rendered when `!isRunning && model.ble.connectionState != "ready"` (line 59, lowercase "ready" confirmed); `GooseBLEClient.buzz` guards against nil `activePeripheral`/`commandCharacteristic` with OSLog-only no-op — double-guarded at BLE layer |

**Score:** 4/4 truths verified (automated); human verification required for runtime behavior

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `GooseSwift/GooseBLEClient+Haptics.swift` | `buzz(loops:)` BLE haptic command primitive | ✓ VERIFIED | 21 lines; extension on GooseBLEClient; guards + clamp + writeValue + OSLog |
| `GooseSwift/BreatheView.swift` | BreatheView + BreathePhase full session screen | ✓ VERIFIED | 141 lines; BreathePhase enum + BreatheView struct; complete session loop |
| `GooseSwift/MoreRouteModels.swift` | MoreRoute.breathe + wellnessRoutes + MoreRouteStatus.breathe | ✓ VERIFIED | `case breathe` at line 19; `wellnessRoutes: [MoreRoute] = [.breathe]` at line 113; `var breathe: MoreStatusKind` at line 132; all 4 computed vars (title/subtitle/systemImage/statusKeyPath) have .breathe arms |
| `GooseSwift/MoreView.swift` | Wellness section + .breathe destination arm | ✓ VERIFIED | `Section("Wellness") { routeRows(MoreRoute.wellnessRoutes) }` at line 78; `case .breathe: BreatheView()` at line 168 |
| `GooseSwift/MoreDataStore.swift` | breathe: .ready at both MoreRouteStatus construction sites | ✓ VERIFIED | `grep -c "breathe: .ready"` returns 2 — confirmed at `@Published var routeStatus` initializer (line 28) and `refreshRouteStatus` function (line 165) |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|-----|--------|---------|
| `BreatheView.swift` | `GooseBLEClient.buzz(loops:)` | `model.ble.buzz(loops: 1)` | ✓ WIRED | 3 calls confirmed (inhale/hold/exhale phase transitions); `@Environment(GooseAppModel.self)` provides `model` |
| `BreatheView.swift` | `GooseAppModel.ble.connectionState` | `@Environment(GooseAppModel.self)` | ✓ WIRED | `model.ble.connectionState != "ready"` at line 59 — lowercase "ready" confirmed, not "Connected" |
| `MoreView.swift` | `BreatheView.swift` | `navigationDestination case .breathe` | ✓ WIRED | `case .breathe: BreatheView()` inside `destination(for:)` switch at line 168; `navigationDestination(for: MoreRoute.self)` at line 99 |
| `MoreRouteModels.swift` | `MoreDataStore.swift` | `MoreRouteStatus.breathe` memberwise initializer | ✓ WIRED | Both construction sites updated with `breathe: .ready`; Swift memberwise initializer would fail to compile if either were missing |
| `GooseBLEClient+Haptics.swift` | `GooseBLEClient.commandCharacteristic` | `activePeripheral.writeValue(_:for: commandCharacteristic, type:)` | ✓ WIRED | Direct property access in extension; pattern matches other +Commands.swift extensions |
| `GooseBLEClient+Haptics.swift` | `GooseBLEClient.writeType(for:)` | helper call | ✓ WIRED | `writeType(for: commandCharacteristic)` at line 12 — reuses existing helper, not redefined |

### Data-Flow Trace (Level 4)

BreatheView renders dynamic state (`currentPhase.label`, `circleScale`, `isRunning`) driven by the internal `phaseTask` session loop — not from an external data source. The `model.ble` reference flows from `@Environment(GooseAppModel.self)` which is injected by `AppShellView` → `GooseSwiftApp`. No hollow props detected — `model.ble.connectionState` and `model.ble.buzz` are live BLE state, not hardcoded values.

| Artifact | Data Variable | Source | Produces Real Data | Status |
|----------|---------------|--------|--------------------|--------|
| `BreatheView.swift` | `currentPhase`, `circleScale`, `isRunning` | Internal `phaseTask` `@State` loop | Yes — driven by `Task { @MainActor in repeat/while }` | ✓ FLOWING |
| `BreatheView.swift` | `model.ble.connectionState` | `GooseBLEClient.connectionState` via `@Environment` | Yes — live BLE state updated by `GooseBLEClient` delegate | ✓ FLOWING |

### Behavioral Spot-Checks

| Behavior | Command | Result | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| buzz file has no buildCommandFrame | `grep -c "buildCommandFrame" GooseSwift/GooseBLEClient+Haptics.swift` | 0 | ✓ PASS |
| Payload is Data([0x13, clamped]) | Read file line 17 | `let payload = Data([0x13, clamped])` | ✓ PASS |
| connectionState uses lowercase "ready" | `grep -c '"Connected"' BreatheView.swift` | 0; `grep -c '"ready"' BreatheView.swift` → 1 | ✓ PASS |
| buzz called 3x per cycle | `grep -c "model\.ble\.buzz" BreatheView.swift` | 3 | ✓ PASS |
| .onDisappear present | `grep -c "onDisappear" BreatheView.swift` | 1 | ✓ PASS |
| Both MoreDataStore sites updated | `grep -c "breathe: .ready" MoreDataStore.swift` | 2 | ✓ PASS |
| @Environment(GooseAppModel.self) used | Read BreatheView.swift line 24 | `@Environment(GooseAppModel.self) private var model` | ✓ PASS |
| Both files registered in project.pbxproj | `grep "BreatheView\|GooseBLEClient+Haptics" project.pbxproj` | PBXBuildFile + PBXFileReference + PBXGroup + PBXSourcesBuildPhase entries present for both files | ✓ PASS |
| No debt markers | `grep -n "TBD\|FIXME\|XXX"` across all modified files | 0 matches | ✓ PASS |

### Probe Execution

Step 7c: SKIPPED — no probe scripts declared in plan or summary; phase produces Swift UI/BLE code with no standalone runnable probe scripts.

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| HAP-01 | 70-01-PLAN.md | `buzz(loops:)` fire-and-forget BLE haptic command writing Data([0x13, N]) to commandCharacteristic | ✓ SATISFIED | `GooseBLEClient+Haptics.swift` exists and implements exactly this; UInt8 clamping present; OSLog confirmed |
| HAP-02 | 70-02-PLAN.md | BreatheView with paced 4s/4s/4s box-breathing session, haptic pacing via buzz, navigation via MoreRoute.breathe | ✓ SATISFIED | All 5 artifacts verified; all key links wired; session loop confirmed correct |

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| None | — | — | — | — |

No debt markers (TBD/FIXME/XXX), no placeholder returns (`return null`, `return []`), no hardcoded empty state passed to rendering. `stopSession()` contains `withAnimation` which is correct behavior, not a stub.

Note: `stopSession()` does not guard against calling `withAnimation` when `phaseTask` is already nil (e.g., on first `.onDisappear` before ever starting). This is safe because `phaseTask?.cancel()` is a no-op on nil, `isRunning = false` on already-false is a no-op, and `withAnimation { circleScale = 0.6 }` on an already-0.6 value produces no visual artifact. This is acceptable, not a blocker.

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. WHOOP Haptic Pacing — Live Device Test

**Test:** With WHOOP 5.0 connected and app in Breathe screen, tap Start and observe one full cycle (12 seconds minimum)
**Expected:** Circle animates correctly for each 4s phase; WHOOP strap vibrates once at the start of inhale, once at hold, once at exhale; OSLog shows 3 `buzz.sent` entries per cycle
**Why human:** BLE write to commandCharacteristic and WHOOP motor response cannot be verified without a live device and OSLog streaming

#### 2. Disconnected Banner State

**Test:** With WHOOP disconnected (or Bluetooth off), open More > Wellness > Breathe
**Expected:** "Connect WHOOP to enable haptics" banner is visible below the phase label before starting; banner disappears immediately when Start is tapped (isRunning becomes true)
**Why human:** SwiftUI conditional rendering based on live BLE connectionState requires UI observation

#### 3. Stop Mid-Session Reset

**Test:** Tap Start, wait ~2 seconds into inhale phase, tap Stop
**Expected:** Animation stops; circle animates back to small (0.6 scale) over 0.4s; phase label resets to "INHALE"; Start button reappears
**Why human:** State machine reset and animation behavior require runtime UI observation

#### 4. Back-Navigation Task Cancellation

**Test:** Tap Start, wait 1 second, tap back (< button in navigation bar)
**Expected:** No further OSLog `buzz.sent` entries after navigation; no crash; MoreView shown cleanly
**Why human:** `.onDisappear { stopSession() }` wiring is verified in code but runtime Task cancellation efficacy requires OSLog streaming to confirm no zombie buzz calls occur

### Gaps Summary

No gaps. All 4 roadmap success criteria are verified at the code level. All 8 plan must-have truths pass automated checks. Both artifacts are substantive (not stubs), wired to real data sources, and registered in the Xcode project. The 4 human verification items are runtime/device behaviors that cannot be evaluated by static analysis — they are standard post-implementation acceptance tests for BLE and animation code.
